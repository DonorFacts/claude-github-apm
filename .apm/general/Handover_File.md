# APM Handover File - Claude GitHub APM Framework - 2025-01-16

## Section 1: Handover Overview

*   **Outgoing Agent ID:** General_Framework_Developer_1
*   **Incoming Agent ID:** General_Framework_Developer_2 (To be assigned)
*   **Reason for Handover:** Context Limit Approaching / Strategic Session Transition
*   **Memory Bank Configuration:**
    *   **Location(s):** Not yet established - framework under development
    *   **Structure:** To be determined - considering GitHub-based approach
*   **Brief Project Status Summary:** Initial GitHub-APM integration framework established with build system, documentation, and example post-processors. Ready for expansion of post-processing templates and GitHub automation.

## Section 2: Project Goal & Current Objectives (Relevant Scope)

**Main Goal:** Build a comprehensive GitHub-integrated enhancement layer for Claude Code APM that provides enterprise-scale project management capabilities while maintaining simplicity for small projects.

**Current Objectives:**
1. Complete post-processing templates for all core APM prompts
2. Create GitHub automation scripts for issue creation and synchronization
3. Build CLI wrapper for easy framework usage
4. Test framework with journal-ai-cli as guinea pig project

## Section 3: Implementation Plan Status (Relevant Scope)

*   **Link to Main Plan:** Not formalized - framework is bootstrap phase
*   **Current Phase/Focus:** Phase 1: Core GitHub Integration Build System
*   **Completed Tasks (within current scope or recently):**
    *   Directory structure with APM symlinks - Status: Completed
    *   GitHub issue type hierarchy design - Status: Completed
    *   Build system (create-command-files.js) - Status: Completed
    *   Example post-processor (manager-plan.md) - Status: Completed
    *   Framework documentation - Status: Completed
    *   Feature branch creation and initial commit - Status: Completed
*   **Tasks In Progress (within current scope):**
    *   Create remaining post-processor templates - **Current Status:** Not started
    *   Test build system - **Current Status:** Ready to test
*   **Upcoming Tasks (immediate next relevant to scope):**
    *   Build GitHub automation scripts
    *   Create CLI tool wrapper
    *   Test with journal-ai-cli project
*   **Deviations/Changes from Plan (Relevant Scope):** None - following planned approach

## Section 4: Key Decisions & Rationale Log (Relevant Scope)

*   **Decision:** Use build-time transformation instead of runtime processing - **Rationale:** Better performance, predictable output, easier debugging - **Approved By:** User - **Date:** 2025-01-16
*   **Decision:** GitHub issue hierarchy: phase→project→epic→feature→task/bug - **Rationale:** Maps naturally to APM planning structure and enterprise needs - **Approved By:** User - **Date:** 2025-01-16
*   **Decision:** Use feature branch workflow - **Rationale:** Better code organization, focused PRs, stable main branch - **Approved By:** Implicit - **Date:** 2025-01-16
*   **Decision:** Symlink to APM library instead of copying - **Rationale:** Stay in sync with upstream changes, cleaner structure - **Approved By:** Design choice - **Date:** 2025-01-16

## Section 5: Active Agent Roster & Current Assignments (Manager Handovers)

*   **Current Agent:** General Framework Developer (single agent mode)
*   **Role:** Architect and implement GitHub-APM integration framework

## Section 6: Recent Memory Bank Entries (Contextual Snippets - Highly Relevant Scope)

Memory Bank not yet established for this project. Key work logged via git commits:
- Commit: 1e44fdd - "feat: implement GitHub-integrated prompt transformation system"

## Section 7: Recent Conversational Context & Key User Directives

**Purpose:** Critical insights from recent interactions that guide immediate work.

**Content:**
*   User emphasized build-time processing only, not runtime (ref: "we'll be creating the final generated prompts only during the build process")
*   User wants framework to support both small and enterprise-scale projects intuitively
*   Journal-ai-cli project (../journal-ai-cli) will be guinea pig for testing
*   User has custom GitHub issue types configured (phase, project, epic, feature, task, bug)
*   User prefers meaningful commit messages and proper branch management
*   Current time awareness: 4:08 PM PST (user corrected timestamp issue)
*   User familiar with APM handover protocols and wants them followed

## Section 8: Critical Code Snippets / Configuration / Outputs (Relevant Scope)

```javascript
// lib/create-command-files.js - Core build system class
class PromptBuilder {
  constructor() {
    this.config = {
      sourceDir: '.apm/prompts',
      postProcessDir: 'lib/post-processing',
      outputDir: 'dist/prompts',
      githubTemplatesDir: 'lib/github-templates'
    };
  }
  
  // Key methods:
  // - build(): Main entry point
  // - processPromptDirectory(): Process originals/ez
  // - applyPostProcessor(): Apply transformations
  // - injectGitHubContext(): Add GitHub-specific content
  // - addIssueTypeAwareness(): Map to issue types
}
```

```json
// package.json scripts
{
  "build:prompts": "node lib/create-command-files.js",
  "build": "npm run build:prompts",
  "clean": "rm -rf dist"
}
```

## Section 9: Current Obstacles, Challenges & Risks (Relevant Scope)

*   **Minor Issue:** TypeScript declaration warning for fs-extra - **Status:** Low priority, can add @types/fs-extra later
*   **Design Question:** Memory Bank storage approach for GitHub integration - **Status:** Needs user input
*   **Design Question:** Agent identity management in GitHub - **Status:** Needs user input
*   **Design Question:** Auto-detect vs manual configuration for project scale - **Status:** Needs user input

## Section 10: Outstanding User/Manager Directives or Questions (Relevant Scope)

*   Priority unclear: Which post-processor templates to create first?
*   Approach needed: How to handle GitHub automation (scripts vs integrated)?
*   Storage decision: Where to persist Memory Bank in GitHub ecosystem?
