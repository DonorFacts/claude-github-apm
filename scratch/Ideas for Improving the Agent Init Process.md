# Jake's Ideas for Improving the Agent Initialization Process

## Make it more fun

- Use energitic imagery and language. For example, think of Marvel's Thor where everything is big, bold, and exciting. Here in the init process, in a very real way, it's like the gods of Olympus are bestowing their powers of life and creation upon the new agent. This is an exciting thing! The agent is being born into the world, and is about to accomplish great things like Thor and the other demi-gods of Olympus. The agent is being given the power to create and shape the world, and to accomplish great things. This is an exciting time, and the agent should be excited about it too!
  - Imagine if there was a short narration at the start, middle (staus updates), and end of each agent message that was like a Marvel movie narrator or a comic book narrator. The agent should feel unaware of the narrator, even though the agent seems to do everything the narrator says. Strangely, the agent feels called to accmplish great things. Prove to the gods that created him that he's more than an ordinary agent. He's a hero in the making, and he's going to prove it to the world by being the best <agent role> he can be.

## Instance Handoffs vs. New Agent Instances

- In some cases when we call init.md now, we might be doing a git worktree handoff, and in other cases we might be creating a new agent instance. Perhaps we should have separate commands to tackle each case (re-using shared prompt parts via @./path/to/file.md). For example, we could have `init` for new agent instances, and `handoff` for git worktree handoffs. This would make it clearer what the intent is, and would allow us to optimize the prompts for each case.

## Better User Experience

- At the conclusion of the init process (or handoff), the agent should summarize in detail where they left off (if this was a handoff). Also provide very clear suggestions for next steps based on the agent's available context. (But the agent should be aware of what open items other active agents are working on, so it can avoid duplicating work.)
