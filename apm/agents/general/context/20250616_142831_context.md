Agent: General - GitHub APM Integration Specialist

## Current State

### Role & Responsibilities
- **Primary Role**: Claude Code instance working on GitHub-integrated APM prompt transformation system
- **Current Focus**: Creating prompt post-processing specialist and preparing for implementation plan
- **Key Responsibilities**: 
  - Developing GitHub-integrated build system for APM prompts
  - Creating 1-to-1 mapping between original and processed prompts
  - Setting up automated transformation pipelines

### Active Work
#### Current Task
- **Task ID**: Prompt Post-Processing Setup
- **Status**: 90% complete
- **Started**: Beginning of session
- **Work Completed**: 
  - Created APM Prompt Post-Processing Specialist prompt
  - Moved to lib/post-processing/ez/apm-init-prompt.md
  - Reverted accidental node_modules modification
- **Work Remaining**: 
  - Context compaction
  - Implementation plan creation using original APM prompts

#### Work in Progress
- Prompt post-processing specialist file created and relocated
- Ready to begin implementation planning phase

### Recent Context

#### Decisions Made
1. **Decision**: Created specialized prompt for post-processing
   - **Rationale**: Need dedicated agent for 1-to-1 prompt transformation
   - **Impact**: Enables systematic prompt processing
   - **Time**: Just completed

2. **Decision**: Avoided modifying node_modules files
   - **Rationale**: Never modify external dependencies
   - **Impact**: Maintained clean project structure
   - **Time**: After initial creation

#### Problems Encountered
- **Issue**: Initially created file in node_modules
  - **Status**: Resolved
  - **Approach**: Reverted change and created in project directory

#### User Communications
Recent important exchanges:
- 14:20: User requested prompt engineering specialist for post-processing
- 14:25: User clarified focus on 1-to-1 mapping for original/ez prompts
- 14:27: User corrected node_modules modification
- 14:28: User moved file to lib/post-processing/ez/apm-init-prompt.md

### Understanding & Insights

#### Project Patterns
- GitHub-integrated APM system in development
- Original prompts in nested structure at /src/prompts/original/
- Processed prompts in flat structure at /src/prompts/ez/
- Build system will automate transformation

#### Technical Context
- **Architecture**: APM multi-agent system with specialized roles
- **Constraints**: Must maintain 1-to-1 mapping between prompts
- **Dependencies**: APM framework from node_modules

### Pending Items

#### Immediate Next Steps
1. Compact current context
2. Create implementation plan using original APM prompts
3. Set up build system for prompt transformation

#### Waiting For
- User guidance on implementation plan specifics

#### Questions/Concerns
- Specific requirements for context compaction
- Implementation plan scope and priorities

### Memory Bank Status
- **Last Update**: N/A - no formal Memory Bank in this project yet
- **Uncommitted Changes**: None
- **Next Log Plans**: Document implementation plan when created

### Environment State
- **Current Directory**: /Users/jakedetels/www/claude-github-apm
- **Open Files**: Context save command reference
- **Modified Files**: Created lib/post-processing/ez/apm-init-prompt.md
- **Tool States**: Git repository on feature/github-integration-build-system branch

### Handover Notes
If context is for handover:
- **Critical Information**: Prompt post-processing specialist created for 1-to-1 transformation
- **Watch Out For**: Never modify node_modules files
- **Recommended Approach**: Use original APM prompts for implementation planning

## Recovery Instructions
To restore this context:
1. Load this context file
2. Review lib/post-processing/ez/apm-init-prompt.md
3. Check /src/prompts/ directory structure
4. Review original APM prompts in node_modules
5. Continue with context compaction and implementation planning
