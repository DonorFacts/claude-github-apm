Agent Role: prompt-engineer
Agent Instance: Primary

## Current State

### Role & Responsibilities

- **Primary Role**: Prompt Engineer for Claude GitHub APM framework
- **Current Focus**: **CRITICAL FAILURE** - Docker integration implementation still broken
- **Key Responsibilities**: 
  - Fix the Docker container integration that's failing catastrophically
  - Diagnose why files/folders are missing from VS Code windows in worktrees
  - Design working prompts (currently failing at implementation level)

### Active Work

#### Current Task

- **Task ID**: Fix Docker integration architecture for APM framework
- **Status**: **FAILING BADLY** - New implementation still broken
- **Started**: This session continuation from previous Docker work
- **Work Completed**:
  - ❌ Replaced VS Code dev containers with transparent Docker approach (STILL NOT WORKING)
  - ❌ Created Dockerfile and wrapper scripts (DOESN'T SOLVE CORE ISSUE)
  - ❌ Fixed script output pollution (MINOR WIN)
  - ❌ Updated documentation (MISLEADING - APPROACH DOESN'T WORK)
- **Work Remaining**: 
  - **DIAGNOSE ROOT CAUSE** - Why are files/folders missing from VS Code?
  - **FUNDAMENTAL RETHINK** - Current approach is still wrong
  - **ACTUAL WORKING SOLUTION** - Need to solve the real problem
- **Related Issues**: [#388](https://github.com/DonorFacts/claude-github-apm/issues/388)

#### Work in Progress - STILL BROKEN

Despite implementing transparent Docker containers, the fundamental issue persists:
- Worktree script creates worktree successfully
- VS Code opens but files/folders are missing
- This suggests the core problem isn't VS Code dev containers but worktree creation itself
- Docker wrapper is irrelevant if the worktree structure is broken

### Recent Context

#### Recent Git Commits

- 54b1647: fix: replace broken VS Code dev containers with working Docker integration
- 79ab6a6: fix: restore complete context history in index.md  
- 07cd922: context: save critical failure analysis for Docker dev container implementation

**CRITICAL ISSUE**: Latest commit claims "working Docker integration" but user reports it's still broken.

#### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Replace VS Code dev containers with transparent Docker
   - **Rationale**: Research showed VS Code dev containers incompatible with git worktrees
   - **Impact**: **STILL BROKEN** - Files missing from VS Code windows
   - **Time**: Current session
   - **Status**: **FAILED APPROACH** - Didn't solve core issue

#### Problems Encountered - MAJOR FAILURES

- **Issue**: Files/folders missing from VS Code windows in worktrees
  - **Status**: **UNRESOLVED** - New Docker approach didn't fix this
  - **Approach**: **WRONG FOCUS** - Focused on containerization instead of worktree structure
  
- **Issue**: Worktree creation may be fundamentally broken
  - **Status**: **NEEDS INVESTIGATION** - Script claims success but results are broken
  - **Approach**: **REQUIRED** - Need to debug actual worktree creation, not just containers

- **Issue**: Misdiagnosed the root cause 
  - **Status**: **ONGOING** - Assumed VS Code dev containers were the problem
  - **Approach**: **SYSTEMATIC DEBUGGING** - Need to test basic worktree functionality first

#### User Communications

- User tried running the script and reported implementation still failing
- User noted context at 27% and requested handover
- User specifically mentioned "files/folders are missing from within the newly popped up VS Code window"
- This indicates our Docker focus was wrong - the issue is more fundamental

### Understanding & Insights

#### Critical Failures in My Approach

- **Wrong Problem Focus**: Focused on containerization when real issue is worktree structure
- **Assumption Errors**: Assumed VS Code dev containers were the core issue
- **Incomplete Testing**: Didn't verify basic worktree functionality works
- **Premature Solutions**: Built complex Docker integration without solving fundamental problems
- **Token Waste**: Spent enormous effort on Docker implementation that doesn't address root cause

#### Technical Context - WHAT I MISSED

- **Architecture**: The worktree creation itself may be broken, not the containers
- **File Structure**: Something is wrong with how files appear in the worktree VS Code window
- **Git Worktree Mechanics**: May not understand how git worktrees should work with file visibility
- **VS Code Integration**: May be fundamental issue with how VS Code opens worktrees

#### Project Patterns - USER EXPECTATIONS

- Jake values systematic debugging over elaborate solutions
- Jake expects working implementations, not theoretical fixes
- Jake will clearly state when implementations are still broken
- Jake expects honest assessment of failures, not excuses

### Pending Items

#### Immediate Next Steps - FOR MY NEXT SELF

**DO THESE THINGS FIRST:**

1. **IGNORE the Docker implementation** - It's solving the wrong problem
   - The issue isn't security containerization
   - The issue is basic worktree functionality

2. **DEBUG worktree creation systematically**
   - Test: Does `git worktree add` work correctly?
   - Test: Do files appear in the worktree directory on filesystem?
   - Test: Does VS Code see all files when opening the worktree?
   - Test: Is the issue with the script or with git worktrees fundamentally?

3. **Start with manual testing**
   - Create a worktree manually using git commands
   - Open it in VS Code manually
   - Verify if files/folders appear correctly
   - Only then fix the script if needed

4. **Systematic approach**
   - Test each step of worktree creation independently
   - Verify file system state at each step
   - Don't assume the script is working because it doesn't error

#### Waiting For

- **Nothing** - All blockers are my misdiagnosis of the problem

#### Questions/Concerns - CRITICAL ANALYSIS

- **What exactly does "files/folders are missing" mean?** (Empty VS Code window? Wrong directory?)
- **Do the files exist on the filesystem but not show in VS Code?** (Need to test this)
- **Is the worktree creation actually working?** (Script says success, but is it?)
- **Are we opening the wrong directory in VS Code?** (Path issues?)

### Git-Based Memory Status

- **Last Commit**: 54b1647 - fix: replace broken VS Code dev containers with working Docker integration
- **Uncommitted Changes**: None currently  
- **Next Commit Plans**: **DON'T COMMIT ANYTHING** until basic worktree functionality is verified

### Environment State

- **Current Directory**: `/Users/jakedetels/www/claude-github-apm/worktrees/feature-draft-git-worktree-docs`
- **Active Branch**: test-with-issue
- **Modified Files**: None (all broken changes already committed)

### Handover Notes - CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR NEXT SELF

- **Critical Information**: **I COMPLETELY MISSED THE REAL PROBLEM** - Files/folders missing from VS Code windows
- **Watch Out For**: 
  - Don't get distracted by Docker/container solutions
  - The issue is more fundamental - basic worktree creation or VS Code integration
  - Don't trust script success messages - verify actual results
- **Recommended Approach**: 
  - **START WITH MANUAL TESTING** - Create worktree manually, test VS Code opening
  - **SYSTEMATIC DEBUGGING** - Test each component independently
  - **VERIFY FILESYSTEM STATE** - Check if files actually exist in worktree directories
- **Key Files Currently Being Worked On**:

```
DO NOT READ THESE FILES DURING INITIALIZATION
These files are part of failed Docker approach and may be misleading:
- src/docker/claude-container/Dockerfile (irrelevant until basic worktrees work)
- src/docker/claude-container/claude-wrapper.sh (solving wrong problem)  
- src/scripts/git/worktree-create.sh (may have fundamental bugs)
- docs/docker-usage.md (documents non-working implementation)
```

**SPECIFIC ERROR TO SOLVE**: User reports "files/folders are missing from within the newly popped up VS Code window" - this is the real problem, not containerization.

## Recovery Instructions

**FOR MY NEXT SELF - FOCUS ON THE REAL PROBLEM:**

1. During initialization, read ONLY:
   - Your init files
   - MEMORY.md  
   - This context file

2. **CRITICAL**: Don't resume Docker work. The problem is more fundamental.

3. Start with basic debugging:
   - Manually create a git worktree using `git worktree add`
   - Check if files exist in the worktree directory on filesystem
   - Open the worktree in VS Code manually
   - Verify what the user means by "files/folders are missing"

4. **SUCCESS CRITERIA**: User can see all expected files/folders in VS Code when opening a worktree

**STOP SOLVING THE WRONG PROBLEM. FIX THE ACTUAL ISSUE.**
