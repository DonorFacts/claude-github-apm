# Agent Context Snapshot

Generated: 2025-06-26T14:23:30Z
Agent Role: prompt-engineer
Agent Instance: Primary

## Current State

### Role & Responsibilities

- **Primary Role**: Prompt Engineer for Claude GitHub APM framework
- **Current Focus**: Worktree and PR workflow enhancements with GitHub issue integration
- **Key Responsibilities**: 
  - Designing and optimizing prompts for AI effectiveness
  - Creating clear documentation for agent workflows
  - Ensuring efficient context transfer between agents
  - Token optimization and prompt conciseness
  - Implementing relative path requirements and link sharing standards

### Active Work

#### Current Task

- **Task ID**: Complete worktree and PR workflow enhancement
- **Status**: completed
- **Started**: This session continuation
- **Work Completed**:
  - Enhanced PR creation workflow with automatic GitHub issue integration
  - Created `src/scripts/git/pr-create.sh` for complete workflow automation
  - Updated prompts to use script references instead of inline bash
  - Added comprehensive worktree removal system with safety checks
  - Implemented environment detection for agent boundary enforcement
  - Added automatic issue closure in worktree removal process
  - Successfully tested complete workflow: auto-created [GitHub issue #382](https://github.com/DonorFacts/claude-github-apm/issues/382) and [PR #383](https://github.com/DonorFacts/claude-github-apm/pull/383)
  - Added relative path and link sharing requirements to `src/prompts/agents/init.md`
  - Updated constructive criticism guidelines in agent initialization
- **Work Remaining**: None - ready for handover
- **Related Issues**: [#382](https://github.com/DonorFacts/claude-github-apm/issues/382)

#### Work in Progress

All tasks completed. Ready for session handover.

### Recent Context

#### Recent Git Commits

- 7abefef: refactor: extract PR creation logic to reusable script
- e62bda3: feat: enhance worktree and PR workflows with GitHub issue integration

#### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Extract bash scripts from prompts to `src/scripts/` for token optimization
   - **Rationale**: Follows CRITICAL RULE in MEMORY.md - scripts don't belong in prompts
   - **Impact**: 75%+ token reduction while maintaining functionality
   - **Time**: This session
   - **Approved By**: Jake

2. **Decision**: Automatic GitHub issue creation when no issue number in branch name
   - **Rationale**: Ensures all PRs have proper issue tracking
   - **Impact**: Seamless issue management for all workflows
   - **Time**: This session
   - **Based On**: User request for comprehensive issue integration

3. **Decision**: Add relative path and link sharing requirements to all agents
   - **Rationale**: Improves clickability, greppability, and portability
   - **Impact**: Better DX and consistent file references across agents
   - **Time**: This session
   - **Approved By**: Jake after constructive criticism discussion

#### Problems Encountered

- **Issue**: GitHub CLI compatibility with `--json` flag
  - **Status**: Resolved
  - **Approach**: Updated script to use compatible CLI patterns
  - **GitHub Issue**: None (technical implementation detail)

#### User Communications

- Early: Jake requested GitHub issue integration in PR workflow
- Mid: Jake corrected approach about script extraction from prompts
- Late: Jake provided concrete examples supporting relative path requirement
- Current: Jake requested context save for handover

### Understanding & Insights

#### Project Patterns

- Token optimization through script extraction is critical for agent memory health
- Complete workflow automation reduces cognitive load and ensures consistency
- User provides concrete evidence when challenging agent assumptions
- Constructive criticism leads to better understanding and implementation

#### Technical Context

- **Architecture**: Git worktrees enable branch isolation with agent handover system
- **Constraints**: Claude Code cannot cd outside original directory
- **Dependencies**: GitHub CLI, VS Code tasks for automation
- **GitHub Integration**: Automatic issue creation and PR linking for complete tracking

### Pending Items

#### Immediate Next Steps

1. Monitor performance of new workflow in actual usage
2. Consider additional script extractions for other lengthy bash sections
3. Apply relative path consistency across existing prompts

#### Waiting For

- User feedback on workflow performance
- Potential additional requirements for worktree management

#### Questions/Concerns

- None - workflow is complete and tested

### Git-Based Memory Status

- **Last Commit**: 7abefef - refactor: extract PR creation logic to reusable script
- **Uncommitted Changes**: Context save and memory updates
- **Next Commit Plans**: Commit context save and updated memory

### Environment State

- **Current Directory**: `/Users/jakedetels/www/claude-github-apm/worktrees/feature-draft-git-worktree-docs`
- **Active Branch**: feature-draft-git-worktree-docs
- **Modified Files**: 
  - `src/prompts/agents/init.md` (added new requirements)
  - `apm/agents/prompt-engineer/MEMORY.md` (updated with new patterns)

### Handover Notes

If context is for handover:

- **Critical Information**: Complete worktree and PR workflow system is implemented and tested
- **Watch Out For**: Scripts need executable permissions when created
- **Recommended Approach**: Test workflows in different branch scenarios
- **Key Files to Review**: 

```
DO NOT READ THESE FILES DURING INITIALIZATION
These files will only be read if/when the user chooses to resume this work:
- src/scripts/git/pr-create.sh (complete PR creation workflow)
- src/scripts/git/generate-issue-body.sh (automatic issue body generation)
- src/scripts/git/worktree-remove.sh (comprehensive worktree cleanup)
- src/prompts/git/pr/create.md (updated PR creation prompts)
- src/prompts/git/worktrees/ (all worktree management prompts)
```

## Recovery Instructions

To restore this context:

1. During initialization, read ONLY:
   - Your init files (generic + role-specific)
   - Your MEMORY.md
   - This context file
2. Present work options to user and wait for direction
3. If user chooses to resume:
   - Review recent commits if needed
   - Test workflows if requested
   - Continue with any new enhancements
4. Continue with work as directed
