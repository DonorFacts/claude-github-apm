Agent Role: prompt-engineer
Agent Instance: Primary

## Current State

### Role & Responsibilities

- **Primary Role**: Prompt Engineer for Claude GitHub APM framework
- **Current Focus**: APM Slack Integration v2.0 - Multi-Agent Coordination Enhancement
- **Key Responsibilities**: 
  - Designing and optimizing prompts for AI effectiveness
  - Creating comprehensive project documentation and architecture specifications
  - Token optimization and architectural decision making
  - Framework integration strategy and coordination system design

### Active Work

#### Current Task

- **Task ID**: APM Slack Integration Phase 2 Architecture Design
- **Status**: completed
- **Started**: This session
- **Work Completed**:
  - Researched latest multi-agent coordination patterns (2024-2025)
  - Analyzed current APM framework capabilities and Jake's existing multi-agent setup
  - Discovered Jake already runs 9-12 concurrent Claude Code instances across 3+ VS Code windows
  - Created comprehensive v2.0 architecture design document (94KB specification)
  - Updated original Phase 2 planning to reflect coordination enhancement approach
  - Successfully demonstrated Slack integration with live bot token
- **Work Remaining**: Implementation of the coordination layer (next developer task)
- **Related Issues**: APM Slack Integration project

#### Work in Progress

Design documents completed and ready for implementation phase.

### Recent Context

#### Recent Git Commits

No commits made during this session - documentation updates ready to commit.

#### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Shifted from cloud infrastructure approach to local coordination enhancement
   - **Rationale**: Jake already successfully runs 9-12 CC instances on MacBook Pro - need coordination, not scaling
   - **Impact**: Simpler, more cost-effective architecture focused on agent registry and task assignment
   - **Time**: During research phase
   - **Approved By**: Jake (implicit through discussion)

2. **Decision**: Use bot tokens (`xoxb-`) instead of user tokens for Slack integration  
   - **Rationale**: Bot tokens don't expire (unlike 12-hour user token rotation), have proper scopes
   - **Impact**: Eliminates token rotation complexity, more stable authentication
   - **Time**: During token testing phase
   - **Approved By**: Jake provided working bot token

3. **Decision**: Focus on bidirectional Slack communication and autonomous task assignment
   - **Rationale**: Key missing piece is human oversight and cross-instance coordination
   - **Impact**: Enables true autonomous agent orchestration with human control
   - **Time**: After analyzing use cases
   - **Approved By**: Jake's interest in autonomous agents with Slack oversight

#### Problems Encountered

- **Issue**: Initial assumption that MacBook Pro couldn't handle multiple CC instances
  - **Status**: Resolved
  - **Approach**: Researched actual evidence, found Jake already runs 9-12 instances successfully
  - **GitHub Issue**: Not tracked - research-based correction

#### User Communications

Recent important exchanges:

- Jake challenged my unfounded assumption about MacBook Pro limitations - led to better architecture
- Jake clarified his current multi-agent setup (3+ VS Code windows, 1-4 CC instances each)
- Jake requested focus on practical implementation without cloud dependencies
- Jake emphasized need for bidirectional Slack communication and autonomous operation

### Understanding & Insights

#### Project Patterns

- **Multi-agent coordination**: Jake's workflow already proves local multi-agent scaling works
- **Documentation-driven development**: Comprehensive specs enable smooth handoffs to implementation teams
- **Research-based architecture**: Deep research into latest patterns (CrewAI, AutoGPT, GitHub Copilot agents) informs better design
- **Token optimization focus**: APM framework consistently prioritizes efficient token usage

#### Technical Context

- **Architecture**: Local-first multi-agent coordination with Slack as human interface
- **Constraints**: Must work with existing VS Code + worktree workflow, no cloud dependencies required
- **Dependencies**: Slack bot integration, agent registry system, task assignment engine
- **GitHub Integration**: Plans for issue tracking, PR coordination, Implementation Plan integration

### Pending Items

#### Immediate Next Steps

1. Next developer implements agent registry system (Week 1)
2. Bidirectional Slack command processing (Week 2) 
3. Task assignment and agent spawning engine (Week 3)

#### Waiting For

- Implementation team to pick up v2.0 architecture specification
- Testing of coordination system with Jake's existing multi-agent setup

#### Questions/Concerns

- Need validation that agent spawning in new terminal tabs works reliably across different VS Code windows
- Performance monitoring needed to ensure coordination overhead stays minimal

### Git-Based Memory Status

- **Last Commit**: Not applicable - documentation session
- **Uncommitted Changes**: 
  - docs/planning/slack-integration-v2.md (new comprehensive design)
  - docs/planning/slack-integration.md (updated Phase 2 scope)
- **Next Commit Plans**: Commit design documentation updates

### Environment State

- **Current Directory**: /workspace/worktrees/feature-multi-agent-memory-architecture
- **Active Branch**: feature-multi-agent-memory-architecture
- **Modified Files**: New design docs ready for commit
- **Slack Integration**: Live bot token configured and tested successfully

### Handover Notes

**Critical Information**: 
- Complete v2.0 architecture specification ready at `docs/planning/slack-integration-v2.md`
- Jake's current setup: 3+ VS Code windows, 9-12 concurrent CC instances - coordination enhancement needed, not infrastructure scaling
- Working Slack bot token configured: `[REDACTED]`
- Phase 1 foundation complete and operational

**Watch Out For**: 
- Avoid cloud infrastructure solutions - Jake's MacBook Pro handles multi-agent workload effectively
- Focus on coordination layer, not replacing existing workflow
- Bidirectional communication is key requirement

**Recommended Approach**: 
- Start with agent registry system for existing CC instances
- Implement Slack command processing for task assignment
- Build agent spawning system for new terminal tabs
- Add dependency tracking and cross-instance messaging

**Key Files to Review**:
```
DO NOT READ THESE FILES DURING INITIALIZATION
These files will only be read if/when the user chooses to resume this work:
- docs/planning/slack-integration-v2.md (comprehensive design specification)
- docs/planning/slack-integration.md (updated original plan)
- docs/inter-agent-communication.md (existing git-based communication design)
- src/scripts/slack/ (existing Phase 1 implementation)
```

## Recovery Instructions

To restore this context:

1. During initialization, read ONLY:
   - Your init files (generic + role-specific)
   - Your MEMORY.md
   - This context file
2. Present work options to user and wait for direction
3. Implementation phase ready to begin with complete specifications
4. Can also assist with refinements to design or answer implementation questions

**Work Status**: Architecture design phase complete. Ready for implementation handoff or further prompt engineering work.
