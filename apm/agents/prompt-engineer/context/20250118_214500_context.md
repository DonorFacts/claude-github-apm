# Agent Context Snapshot

Generated: 2025-01-18T21:45:00Z
Agent Role: prompt-engineer
Agent Instance: Primary

## Current State

### Role & Responsibilities

- **Primary Role**: Prompt Engineer for Claude GitHub APM framework
- **Current Focus**: Session lifecycle management and TypeScript monitoring design
- **Key Responsibilities**: 
  - Designing and optimizing prompts for AI effectiveness
  - Implementing session tracking with minimal token overhead
  - Maintaining prompt engineering best practices
  - Ensuring token efficiency across all agent prompts

### Active Work

#### Current Task

- **Task ID**: Session lifecycle and monitoring implementation
- **Status**: in_progress
- **Started**: ~3 hours ago
- **Work Completed**:
  - Implemented terminal title management for agents
  - Designed event-based session lifecycle system
  - Created TypeScript monitoring architecture
  - Researched Claude SDK capabilities
  - Updated context health monitoring with handover instructions
- **Work Remaining**:
  - Implement TypeScript session monitor service
  - Create JSONL file watcher
  - Build custom event processing system
  - Integrate with agent session logs at apm/agents/<role>/logs
- **Related Issues**: None tracked in this session

#### Work in Progress

Key designs and implementations ready for next phase:
- TypeScript session monitor design in docs/typescript-session-monitor-design.md
- Claude SDK research in docs/research/claude-sdk.md
- Event processing scripts in scripts/session-tools/

### Recent Context

#### Recent Git Commits

- 04b25c8: feat: implement session lifecycle management with TypeScript monitoring

#### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Shift from agent self-reporting to external log monitoring
   - **Rationale**: Eliminates 100% of token overhead for session tracking
   - **Impact**: Simpler prompts, richer data, better maintainability
   - **Time**: During this session
   - **Approved By**: User through iterative refinement

2. **Decision**: Use TypeScript over bash for monitoring implementation
   - **Rationale**: Type safety, better tooling, easier debugging
   - **Impact**: More maintainable codebase
   - **Time**: User preference stated
   - **Approved By**: User

#### Problems Encountered

- **Issue**: Initial JSONL logging approach would double token usage
  - **Status**: Resolved
  - **Approach**: Designed external monitoring of Claude's native logs
  - **GitHub Issue**: None

#### User Communications

- 18:50: User noted terminal title wasn't set, highlighted prompt effectiveness issue
- 19:30: User concerned about token efficiency of session logging
- 20:45: User concerned about init.md size (>2400 tokens)
- 21:40: User requested context save due to filling context window

### Understanding & Insights

#### Project Patterns

- Terminal titles should be SHORT: just role name, not "APM: Role Agent"
- TypeScript preferred over bash for non-trivial scripts
- Token efficiency is critical - avoid any unnecessary output
- External monitoring >>> self-reporting for efficiency

#### Technical Context

- **Architecture**: Claude logs to ~/.claude/projects/<project-hash>/<session-id>.jsonl
- **Constraints**: 200k context window (Opus & Sonnet), init.md using >1% already
- **Dependencies**: Can leverage Claude's native JSONL logs
- **GitHub Integration**: Not yet implemented for this feature

### Pending Items

#### Immediate Next Steps

1. Implement TypeScript session monitor service
2. Create JSONL file watcher with tail functionality  
3. Build event processor for session lifecycle
4. Integrate with apm/agents/<role>/logs structure
5. Test with real Claude Code sessions

#### Waiting For

- None - ready to proceed with implementation

#### Questions/Concerns

- Optimal structure for apm/agents/<role>/logs vs sessions/
- How to handle multiple concurrent sessions per agent
- Best approach for session ID correlation

### Git-Based Memory Status

- **Last Commit**: 04b25c8 - feat: implement session lifecycle management
- **Uncommitted Changes**: This context save only
- **Next Commit Plans**: After context save completes

### Environment State

- **Current Directory**: /Users/jakedetels/www/claude-github-apm
- **Open Files**: Various prompts and documentation
- **Modified Files**: None (clean after last commit)
- **Active Branch**: feature/github-integration-build-system

### Handover Notes

If context is for handover:

- **Critical Information**: Focus on TypeScript monitoring implementation next
- **Watch Out For**: Token efficiency - external monitoring is key
- **Recommended Approach**: Start with basic file watcher, then add features
- **Key Files to Review**: 
  - docs/typescript-session-monitor-design.md
  - docs/research/claude-sdk.md
  - src/prompts/agents/init.md (session tracking section)

## Recovery Instructions

To restore this context:

1. Load this context file from `apm/agents/prompt-engineer/context/latest.md`
2. Review recent git commits with `git log --oneline -10`
3. Check GitHub issues referenced in commits
4. Review any uncommitted changes with `git status`
5. Continue with TypeScript session monitor implementation
