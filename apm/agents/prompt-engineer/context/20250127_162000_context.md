# Agent Context Snapshot

Generated: 2025-01-27T16:20:00Z
Agent Role: prompt-engineer
Agent Instance: Primary

## Current State

### Role & Responsibilities

- **Primary Role**: Prompt Engineer for Claude GitHub APM framework
- **Current Focus**: APM Slack Integration planning and documentation
- **Key Responsibilities**: 
  - Designing and optimizing prompts for AI effectiveness
  - Creating comprehensive project documentation
  - Token optimization and architectural decision making
  - Framework integration strategy

### Active Work

#### Current Task

- **Task ID**: APM Slack Integration Research & Planning
- **Status**: completed
- **Started**: This session
- **Work Completed**:
  - Comprehensive CrewAI research and analysis (docs/research/tools/CrewAI.md)
  - Detailed 3-phase project plan (docs/planning/slack-integration.md)
  - Complete user/agent guide (docs/slack-integration-guide.md)
  - Strategic decision against CrewAI adoption
  - Architecture design for APM-native Slack integration
- **Work Remaining**: Phase 1 implementation
- **Related Issues**: Slack integration for multi-CC coordination

#### Work in Progress

All documentation completed. Ready to proceed with Phase 1 implementation:
- Foundation (Slack coordinator agent + basic CC coordination)
- Basic Slack bot infrastructure
- CC instance adapter pattern

### Recent Context

#### Recent Git Commits

- 44acba0: docs: add comprehensive APM Slack integration documentation

#### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Reject CrewAI framework adoption for APM Slack integration
   - **Rationale**: Architecture misalignment, token overhead, memory system conflicts
   - **Impact**: Build APM-native solution using existing patterns
   - **Time**: This session
   - **Approved By**: Self-analysis with Jake's guidance

2. **Decision**: Single-bot multi-agent pattern for Slack coordination
   - **Rationale**: More efficient than 12+ separate bot accounts
   - **Impact**: Unified coordination with agent identification via message formatting
   - **Time**: This session
   - **Based On**: Earlier research and APM framework principles

3. **Decision**: 3-phase implementation approach
   - **Rationale**: Manageable scope with progressive feature additions
   - **Impact**: Foundation → Core Features → Advanced Features
   - **Time**: This session
   - **Approved By**: Planning phase analysis

#### Problems Encountered

- **Issue**: Initial recommendation of CrewAI without full APM context
  - **Status**: Resolved
  - **Approach**: Deep dive into APM README and framework principles
  - **Lesson**: Always consider full framework context before external tool recommendations

#### User Communications

- Early: Jake asked about CrewAI fit with APM framework vision
- Mid: Requested comprehensive documentation before implementation
- Current: Approved for Phase 1 start after handover due to context limits

### Understanding & Insights

#### Project Patterns

- APM framework prioritizes self-hosted, token-optimized solutions
- Existing 3-tier memory system is sophisticated and shouldn't be bypassed
- Git-native workflows and Implementation Plan integration are core values
- External dependencies conflict with framework philosophy

#### Technical Context

- **Architecture**: APM agent framework with specialized roles and memory systems
- **Constraints**: Token efficiency critical, no external platform dependencies
- **Dependencies**: GitHub CLI, Slack API, existing APM agent patterns
- **Integration Focus**: Implementation Plans + GitHub workflows + multi-CC coordination

### Pending Items

#### Immediate Next Steps

1. Initialize fresh Prompt Engineer instance
2. Begin Phase 1 implementation (Foundation)
3. Create slack-coordinator agent following APM patterns
4. Set up basic Slack bot infrastructure

#### Waiting For

- User approval to start Phase 1 after context handover

#### Questions/Concerns

- None - comprehensive planning completed, ready for implementation

### Git-Based Memory Status

- **Last Commit**: 44acba0 - docs: add comprehensive APM Slack integration documentation
- **Uncommitted Changes**: None
- **Current Branch**: feature-multi-agent-memory-architecture

### Environment State

- **Current Directory**: /Users/jakedetels/www/claude-github-apm/worktrees/feature-multi-agent-memory-architecture
- **Active Branch**: feature-multi-agent-memory-architecture
- **Modified Files**: None (all committed)

### Handover Notes

If context is for handover:

- **Critical Information**: All documentation complete, ready for Phase 1 implementation
- **Watch Out For**: Maintain APM framework principles, avoid external dependencies
- **Recommended Approach**: Follow 3-phase plan exactly as documented
- **Key Files to Review**: 

```
DO NOT READ THESE FILES DURING INITIALIZATION
These files will only be read if/when the user chooses to resume this work:
- docs/research/tools/CrewAI.md (comprehensive analysis and rejection rationale)
- docs/planning/slack-integration.md (detailed 3-phase implementation plan)
- docs/slack-integration-guide.md (user/agent guide for final system)
```

- **Implementation Priority**: Start with Phase 1 Foundation as documented
- **Architecture Decision**: Single-bot multi-agent pattern with APM-native integration

## Recovery Instructions

To restore this context:

1. During initialization, read ONLY:
   - Your init files (generic + role-specific)
   - Your MEMORY.md
   - This context file
2. Present work options to user and wait for direction
3. If user chooses to resume:
   - Read the specific documentation files listed above
   - Review the 3-phase implementation plan
   - Begin Phase 1 Foundation work
4. Continue with Phase 1 implementation as directed
