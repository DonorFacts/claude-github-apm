# Prompt Engineer Agent Context
**Date**: 2025-06-25 12:16:21
**Branch**: feature-draft-git-worktree-docs
**Role**: prompt-engineer
**Session**: Active context save

## Summary
This session focused on terminal productivity tools and prompt optimization. Key achievements include creating VS Code tasks documentation, implementing terminal status updates, and discovering significant prompt reduction opportunities.

## Completed Work

### 1. VS Code Tasks Documentation
- Created comprehensive documentation at `docs/vs-code/tasks.md`
- Defined task structure for agent roles and common operations
- Established naming conventions for multi-agent workflows

### 2. Terminal Status System
- Created `src/prompts/agents/update-status.md` prompt
- Implemented `scripts/update-terminal-title.sh` for status updates
- Integrated emoji for instant visual recognition
- Enabled multi-window agent coordination

### 3. CLAUDE.md Enhancement
- Added guidance on relative paths for script portability
- Emphasized path consistency across worktrees
- Improved clarity on script execution patterns

### 4. Prompt Optimization Discovery
- Analyzed `init.md` prompt (5,289 tokens)
- Created minimized version (1,439 tokens - 72.8% reduction)
- Maintained full functionality with concise language
- Identified systematic approach for prompt reduction

## Key Learnings

### Technical Discoveries
1. **VS Code Task Limitations**: Claude Code cannot invoke VS Code tasks from CLI
   - Feature request noted as out-of-scope
   - Alternative: Direct script execution via shell

2. **Path Management Critical**: 
   - Relative paths essential for worktree portability
   - Scripts must use `../..` navigation patterns
   - Absolute paths break when switching branches

3. **Terminal Title Power**:
   - Supports emoji for instant status recognition
   - Updates persist across command execution
   - Enables visual coordination of multiple agents

4. **Prompt Engineering Insights**:
   - Significant token savings possible (70%+ reduction)
   - Concise language maintains effectiveness
   - Structured formats improve clarity

### Process Improvements
1. Always use relative paths in scripts
2. Include emoji in terminal titles for visual scanning
3. Prioritize prompt conciseness without losing specificity
4. Test scripts across different worktrees before committing

## Active Files Modified
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added relative path guidance
- `docs/vs-code/tasks.md` - Created VS Code tasks reference
- `src/prompts/agents/update-status.md` - Created status update prompt
- `scripts/update-terminal-title.sh` - Created terminal title updater
- `src/prompts/agents/init.md` - Analyzed for optimization

## Next Actions
1. Apply prompt optimization techniques to other agent prompts
2. Create automated prompt analysis tool
3. Establish token budget guidelines per agent role
4. Document prompt optimization patterns

## Context for Next Instance
The Prompt Engineer agent should continue focusing on systematic prompt optimization across all agent roles. The 70% reduction achieved with init.md demonstrates significant potential for token savings. Priority should be given to frequently-used prompts that consume the most context window space.

### Immediate Tasks
- Review and optimize remaining agent prompts
- Create prompt optimization checklist
- Establish token usage benchmarks
- Document best practices for concise prompting

## Environment State
- Working directory: `/Users/jakedetels/www/claude-github-apm/worktrees/feature-draft-git-worktree-docs`
- Git status: Modified files staged, ready for commit
- Terminal status system: Operational
- VS Code tasks: Documented but not implemented

## Session Metrics
- Context window usage: Moderate
- Token optimization potential: High
- Documentation coverage: Expanding
- Tool integration: Progressing
