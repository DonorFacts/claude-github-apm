Agent: Specialized - APM Prompt Engineering Specialist

## Current State

### Role & Responsibilities
- **Primary Role**: APM Prompt Engineering Specialist for GitHub-integrated APM system
- **Current Focus**: Creating and optimizing agent initialization prompts and command structures
- **Key Responsibilities**: 
  - Designing agent initialization prompts
  - Creating command-specific prompts
  - Optimizing prompt clarity and effectiveness
  - Balancing comprehensive guidance with conciseness

### Active Work
#### Current Task
- **Task ID**: Handover Preparation
- **Status**: 95% complete
- **Started**: Mid-session
- **Work Completed**: 
  - Created commit.md guide for git-based memory system
  - Created Scrum Master initialization prompt
  - Created create-project-issues.md command
  - Optimized prompts for appropriate length
- **Work Remaining**: 
  - Complete handover protocol preparation

#### Work in Progress
- Handover documentation preparation
- Context snapshot creation

### Recent Context

#### Decisions Made
1. **Decision**: Replaced Memory Bank with git commits
   - **Rationale**: Git commits serve as natural project memory
   - **Impact**: Simplified tracking, removed redundant documentation
   - **Time**: Early in session

2. **Decision**: Created Scrum Master agent role
   - **Rationale**: Need specialized agent for GitHub issue management
   - **Impact**: Enables automated Implementation Plan → GitHub issue conversion
   - **Time**: Mid-session

3. **Decision**: Used custom GitHub issue types instead of labels
   - **Rationale**: Organization has configured custom types (Phase, Project, Epic, etc.)
   - **Impact**: Requires GraphQL API with special headers
   - **Time**: Mid-session

#### Problems Encountered
- **Issue**: Initial Scrum Master prompt too verbose
  - **Status**: Resolved
  - **Approach**: Condensed to 2/3 original length, created separate command prompts

- **Issue**: GitHub custom issue types in preview
  - **Status**: Addressed
  - **Approach**: Documented GraphQL requirements and special headers

#### User Communications
Recent important exchanges:
- 14:45: User requested git commit guide replacing Memory Bank
- 14:50: User specified GitHub issue hierarchy requirements
- 14:55: User clarified custom issue types (not labels)
- 15:00: User requested Scrum Master prompt optimization
- 15:05: User initiated handover protocol

### Understanding & Insights

#### Project Patterns
- GitHub-integrated APM system in active development
- Focus on automation of project management tasks
- Preference for git-native workflows over custom documentation
- Organization uses custom GitHub issue types at org level

#### Technical Context
- **Architecture**: APM multi-agent system with GitHub integration
- **Constraints**: GitHub GraphQL API required for custom issue types
- **Dependencies**: Shell scripts in scripts/ directory for issue management

### Pending Items

#### Immediate Next Steps
1. Complete handover protocol documentation
2. Create handover prompt per APM guidelines
3. Prepare handover artifacts

#### Waiting For
- None - ready to proceed with handover

#### Questions/Concerns
- Ensure new instance understands GitHub custom issue type requirements
- Maintain continuity of prompt engineering approach

### Memory Bank Status
- **Note**: Project uses git commits instead of traditional Memory Bank
- **Last Commit Reference**: Working on prompt creation
- **Uncommitted Changes**: All prompt files created

### Environment State
- **Current Directory**: /Users/jakedetels/www/claude-github-apm
- **Open Files**: Multiple .claude/commands files
- **Modified Files**: 
  - .claude/commands/commit.md
  - .claude/commands/agents/init-scrum-master.md
  - .claude/commands/agents/scrum-master/create-project-issues.md
- **Tool States**: Git repository on feature/github-integration-build-system branch

### Handover Notes
If context is for handover:
- **Critical Information**: 
  - Project uses git commits as memory system
  - GitHub custom issue types require GraphQL with special header
  - Scrum Master agent handles Implementation Plan → GitHub conversion
- **Watch Out For**: 
  - Don't use labels for issue types
  - Include issue numbers in commit messages
  - Maintain prompt conciseness while preserving quality
- **Recommended Approach**: 
  - Continue prompt engineering focus
  - Test prompts for clarity and completeness
  - Maintain APM framework compatibility
