# Agent Context Snapshot

Generated: 2025-01-18T13:55:00Z
Agent Role: prompt-engineer
Agent Instance: Prompt_Engineer_v2

## Current State

### Role & Responsibilities

- **Primary Role**: Prompt architecture and agent capability design
- **Current Focus**: Terminal tab naming feature for agent initialization
- **Key Responsibilities**: Create agent prompts, optimize for clarity, maintain consistency

### Active Work

#### Current Task

- **Task ID**: Terminal tab naming feature
- **Status**: completed
- **Started**: ~5 minutes ago
- **Work Completed**: 
  - Discovered working terminal naming command: `echo -e "\033]0;[Role Name]\007"`
  - Updated agents/init.md with Step 4 for terminal naming
  - Updated README.md with VS Code settings requirement
  - Updated long-term memory about context-efficient initialization
- **Work Remaining**: None for this task
- **Related Issues**: None tracked

#### Work in Progress

No active code development at this moment.

### Recent Context

#### Recent Git Commits

- 4f60a28: feat: add terminal tab naming during agent initialization
- 19180bb: docs: update README with agent memory and initialization info
- ef3754b: refactor: remove context-check and make monitoring automatic
- 16b6062: refactor: focus long-term memory on enduring principles
- 2f14bc4: feat: simplify memory system and consolidate commands

#### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Use echo -e with escape sequences for terminal naming
   - **Rationale**: Works effectively in VS Code integrated terminal
   - **Impact**: Agents can identify themselves in terminal tabs
   - **Time**: Today
   - **Approved By**: User

2. **Decision**: Don't analyze all existing prompts during init
   - **Rationale**: Wastes context space unnecessarily
   - **Impact**: More efficient agent initialization
   - **Time**: Today
   - **Approved By**: User

#### Problems Encountered

- **Issue**: Initial terminal naming attempts showed escape sequences
  - **Status**: Resolved
  - **Approach**: Found working command with -e flag

#### User Communications

Recent important exchanges:
- 13:54: User confirmed echo -e command works
- 13:52: User provided VS Code settings requirement
- 13:50: User corrected wasteful init behavior
- 13:45: User asked about terminal tab naming

### Understanding & Insights

#### Project Patterns

- Context efficiency is critical - only read what's needed
- Terminal usability improvements help multi-agent workflows
- Documentation should guide users on environment setup
- Agent initialization should be smooth and self-identifying

#### Technical Context

- **Architecture**: Agent prompts in src/prompts/agents/
- **Constraints**: Keep agent and user content separate
- **Dependencies**: VS Code settings for terminal tab naming
- **GitHub Integration**: Not yet implemented for this session

### Pending Items

#### Immediate Next Steps

1. Commit the terminal naming feature changes
2. Consider other agent initialization improvements

#### Waiting For

- None currently

#### Questions/Concerns

- None currently

### Git-Based Memory Status

- **Last Commit**: 4f60a28 - feat: add terminal tab naming
- **Uncommitted Changes**: Updates to init.md and README.md
- **Next Commit Plans**: Commit terminal naming documentation

### Environment State

- **Current Directory**: /Users/jakedetels/www/claude-github-apm
- **Open Files**: This context file being written
- **Modified Files**: src/prompts/agents/init.md, README.md
- **Active Branch**: feature/github-integration-build-system

### Handover Notes

If context is for handover:

- **Critical Information**: Terminal naming works with echo -e "\033]0;Name\007"
- **Watch Out For**: VS Code needs "terminal.integrated.tabs.title": "${sequence}"
- **Recommended Approach**: Continue improving agent initialization experience
- **Key Files to Review**: 
  - src/prompts/agents/init.md (updated with terminal naming)
  - README.md (updated with VS Code settings)
  - apm/agents/prompt-engineer/MEMORY.md (context efficiency lesson)

## Recovery Instructions

To restore this context:

1. Load this context file from `apm/agents/prompt-engineer/context/20250118_135500_context.md`
2. Review recent git commits with `git log --oneline -10`
3. Check GitHub issues referenced in commits (none for this session)
4. Review any uncommitted changes with `git status`
5. Continue with agent initialization improvements
