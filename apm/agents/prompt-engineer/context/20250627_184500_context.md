Agent Role: prompt-engineer
Agent Instance: Primary

## Current State

### Role & Responsibilities

- **Primary Role**: Prompt Engineer for Claude GitHub APM framework
- **Current Focus**: APM Slack Integration Phase 1 Foundation - COMPLETED
- **Key Responsibilities**: 
  - Designing and optimizing prompts for AI effectiveness
  - Creating comprehensive project documentation
  - Token optimization and architectural decision making
  - Framework integration strategy

### Active Work

#### Current Task

- **Task ID**: APM Slack Integration Phase 1 Foundation
- **Status**: completed
- **Started**: This session
- **Work Completed**:
  - Full Phase 1 Foundation implementation complete
  - All APM channels created in Slack workspace
  - User successfully invited to all channels
  - Webhook server, CC adapter, and channel management working
  - Auto-invitation functionality implemented for future users
  - Setup scripts updated with user invitation capabilities
- **Work Remaining**: Phase 2 implementation (GitHub integration, Implementation Plan tracking)
- **Related Issues**: APM Slack Integration project

#### Work in Progress

Phase 1 is complete. Ready for Phase 2 or other prompt engineering work.

### Recent Context

#### Recent Git Commits

- Need to commit: All Slack integration infrastructure and documentation

#### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Completed Phase 1 APM Slack Integration Foundation
   - **Rationale**: All core infrastructure working, user successfully onboarded
   - **Impact**: Multi-instance Claude Code coordination now possible via Slack
   - **Time**: This session
   - **Approved By**: User testing confirmed success

2. **Decision**: Enhanced channel manager with auto-user invitation
   - **Rationale**: User requested automatic channel joining for future setups
   - **Impact**: Future users will be automatically invited to APM channels
   - **Time**: This session
   - **Based On**: User feedback about Slack channel visibility

#### Problems Encountered

- **Issue**: Initial setup script had dependency import errors
  - **Status**: Resolved
  - **Approach**: Applied TDD workflow, created dependency-free setup script
  - **Lesson**: Always test setup scripts in clean environments

- **Issue**: Slack token permissions insufficient for channel creation/invitations
  - **Status**: Resolved
  - **Approach**: Identified exact scopes needed, guided user through adding them
  - **Lesson**: Slack API requires specific scopes for each operation

#### User Communications

- User requested APM Slack Integration implementation
- User provided Slack bot tokens and added required permissions
- User successfully tested full integration
- User requested automatic channel invitations for future users
- User requested context save due to low context

### Understanding & Insights

#### Project Patterns

- APM framework prioritizes self-hosted, token-optimized solutions
- TDD workflow critical for infrastructure scripts
- User prefers comprehensive testing before delivery
- Slack integration follows APM agent patterns (memory system, context saves)

#### Technical Context

- **Architecture**: APM agent framework with Slack coordination layer
- **Constraints**: Token efficiency critical, no external platform dependencies
- **Dependencies**: Slack API, existing APM agent patterns, webhook infrastructure
- **Integration Focus**: Multi-instance Claude Code coordination via Slack channels

### Pending Items

#### Immediate Next Steps

1. Commit all Slack integration work
2. Ready for Phase 2 implementation or other prompt engineering tasks

#### Waiting For

- User direction on next work (Phase 2 or other priorities)

#### Questions/Concerns

- None - Phase 1 complete and tested successfully

### Git-Based Memory Status

- **Last Commit**: Previous work before Slack integration
- **Uncommitted Changes**: All Phase 1 Slack integration infrastructure
- **Next Commit Plans**: Commit complete Phase 1 implementation

### Environment State

- **Current Directory**: /Users/jakedetels/www/claude-github-apm/worktrees/feature-multi-agent-memory-architecture
- **Active Branch**: feature-multi-agent-memory-architecture
- **Modified Files**: Multiple new files for Slack integration

### Handover Notes

If context is for handover:

- **Critical Information**: Phase 1 APM Slack Integration is complete and working
- **Watch Out For**: Context limits approaching, handover recommended
- **Recommended Approach**: Next instance can pick up with Phase 2 or other work
- **Key Files**: All Slack integration files ready for commit

**Files Created/Modified This Session:**

```
DO NOT READ THESE FILES DURING INITIALIZATION
These files are ready for commit and represent completed Phase 1 work:
- src/scripts/slack/setup-phase1-simple.ts (working setup script)
- src/scripts/slack/webhook-server.ts (Express webhook server)
- src/scripts/slack/cc-adapter.ts (CC instance Slack adapter)
- src/scripts/slack/channel-manager.ts (enhanced with user invitations)
- src/scripts/slack/README.md (Phase 1 documentation)
- src/prompts/agents/slack-coordinator/init.md (agent initialization)
- src/prompts/commands/slack-connect.md (CC command)
- src/prompts/commands/slack-status.md (CC command)
- apm/agents/slack-coordinator/MEMORY.md (agent memory)
- apm/agents/slack-coordinator/context/index.md (context structure)
- validate-slack-integration.sh (comprehensive testing)
- invite-to-apm-channels.sh (user invitation script)
- start-slack-coordinator.sh (enhanced startup script)
- add-user-to-channels.js (utility script)
```

**Slack Integration Status:**
- All 9 APM channels created and user invited
- Bot token configured with all required scopes
- Webhook server tested and working
- CC adapter connecting successfully
- Channel management with auto-invitations working
- Phase 1 Foundation complete

## Recovery Instructions

To restore this context:

1. During initialization, read ONLY:
   - Your init files (generic + role-specific)
   - Your MEMORY.md
   - This context file
2. Present work options to user and wait for direction
3. Phase 1 is complete - ready for Phase 2 or other prompt engineering work
4. All Slack integration files are ready to commit
