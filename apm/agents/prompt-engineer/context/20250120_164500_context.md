# Agent Context Snapshot

Generated: 2025-01-20T16:45:00Z
Agent Role: prompt-engineer
Agent Instance: Primary

## Current State

### Role & Responsibilities

- **Primary Role**: Prompt Engineer for Claude GitHub APM framework
- **Current Focus**: Improving agent initialization prompts to prevent context waste
- **Key Responsibilities**: 
  - Designing and optimizing prompts for AI effectiveness
  - Implementing efficient handover mechanisms
  - Ensuring token efficiency across all prompts
  - Creating agent initialization patterns

### Active Work

#### Current Task

- **Task ID**: Prompt initialization improvements
- **Status**: completed
- **Started**: ~30 minutes ago
- **Work Completed**:
  - Analyzed context waste issue during agent initialization
  - Removed confusing "Existing prompts analyzed" line from prompt-engineer init
  - Added explicit "DO NOT read files" instructions during init phase
  - Created two-phase initialization pattern (minimal init → user choice → resume)
  - Moved handover requirements from init.md to context-save.md
  - Updated recovery instructions for user-directed resumption
- **Work Remaining**: Test the handover process
- **Related Issues**: None tracked (improvement work)

#### Work in Progress

All changes have been committed. Ready to test handover process.

### Recent Context

#### Recent Git Commits

- 1f4d206: fix: improve agent initialization to prevent context waste during handovers
- 9d5049f: chore: update context after successful feature commit
- b8cede4: feat: implement ad hoc agent creation and team knowledge base systems

#### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Two-phase initialization pattern
   - **Rationale**: Prevents automatic context consumption during handovers
   - **Impact**: Agents ask user before reading work files
   - **Time**: This session
   - **Approved By**: Jake

2. **Decision**: Move handover requirements to context-save.md
   - **Rationale**: Better separation of concerns - init.md for init, context-save.md for saves
   - **Impact**: Cleaner, more focused prompts
   - **Time**: This session
   - **Approved By**: Jake

#### Problems Encountered

- **Issue**: Agent read too many files during initialization
  - **Status**: Resolved
  - **Approach**: Added explicit boundaries and user-directed resumption
  - **GitHub Issue**: None

#### User Communications

- Start: Jake noticed I read more files than requested during init
- Mid: Jake suggested moving handover instructions to context-save.md
- Late: Jake proposed user-directed resumption pattern
- Current: Preparing for handover test

### Understanding & Insights

#### Project Patterns

- Jake values explanations over apologies when issues arise
- Self-analysis of prompt issues leads to better solutions
- Clear boundaries in prompts prevent unintended behaviors
- User control over context loading is important

#### Technical Context

- **Architecture**: Multi-agent system with role-specific initialization
- **Constraints**: Context window management is critical
- **Dependencies**: Three-tier memory system (MEMORY.md, context, git)
- **GitHub Integration**: Not used in this session

### Pending Items

#### Immediate Next Steps

1. User will test handover process
2. New agent instance will initialize
3. Verify two-phase init works as designed

#### Waiting For

- User to initiate handover test

#### Questions/Concerns

- None at this time

### Git-Based Memory Status

- **Last Commit**: 1f4d206 - fix: improve agent initialization to prevent context waste during handovers
- **Uncommitted Changes**: Just this context file
- **Next Commit Plans**: Commit context save after creation

### Environment State

- **Current Directory**: /Users/jakedetels/www/claude-github-apm/worktrees/feature-ad-hoc-agents-knowledge-base
- **Open Files**: src/prompts/agents/prompt-engineer/init.md (in IDE)
- **Modified Files**: This context file
- **Active Branch**: feature/ad-hoc-agents-knowledge-base

### Handover Notes

If context is for handover:

- **Critical Information**: Successfully improved initialization prompts to prevent context waste
- **Watch Out For**: Test the new two-phase init pattern carefully
- **Recommended Approach**: Let user test handover, observe if agent correctly asks before reading files
- **Key Files to Review**: 

```
DO NOT READ THESE FILES DURING INITIALIZATION
These files will only be read if/when the user chooses to resume this work:
- src/prompts/agents/init.md (lines 105-154: new init pattern)
- src/prompts/agents/prompt-engineer/init.md (lines 99-118: updated response)
- src/prompts/context-save.md (lines 183-193: handover file marking)
```

## Recovery Instructions

To restore this context:

1. During initialization, read ONLY:
   - Your init files (generic + role-specific)
   - Your MEMORY.md
   - This context file
2. Present work options to user and wait for direction
3. If user chooses to resume:
   - Read the specific files listed above
   - Run `git status` to check for uncommitted changes
   - Review recent commits if needed
4. Continue with work as directed
