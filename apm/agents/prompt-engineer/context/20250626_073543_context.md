# Agent Context Snapshot

Generated: 2025-06-26T02:20:00Z
Agent Role: prompt-engineer
Agent Instance: Primary

## Current State

### Role & Responsibilities

- **Primary Role**: Prompt Engineer for Claude GitHub APM framework
- **Current Focus**: Worktree handover system improvements and PR creation automation
- **Key Responsibilities**: 
  - Designing and optimizing prompts for AI effectiveness
  - Creating clear documentation for agent workflows
  - Ensuring efficient context transfer between agents
  - Token optimization and prompt conciseness

### Active Work

#### Current Task

- **Task ID**: Worktree handover system and PR creation
- **Status**: completed
- **Started**: This session
- **Work Completed**:
  - Implemented one-time handover system with not-started/completed directories
  - Renamed verify.md to action-oriented complete-handoff.md
  - Created concise init-handover.md (92% token reduction)
  - Reduced commit.md from 2.5k to 750 tokens
  - Created comprehensive PR creation system
  - Built automated PR body generation script
- **Work Remaining**: None - ready for PR
- **Related Issues**: #371

#### Work in Progress

All tasks completed. Ready to submit final PR with new changes.

### Recent Context

#### Recent Git Commits

- fad43f1: chore: update prompt engineer memory and all context saves
- bbc6a5a: refactor: reduce commit.md from 2.5k to 750 tokens  
- e57ce9d: refactor: implement one-time handover system with improved clarity

#### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Use action-directed filenames for prompts
   - **Rationale**: Verbs indicate commands (complete-handoff.md not verify.md)
   - **Impact**: Clearer prompt purpose and usage
   - **Time**: This session
   - **Approved By**: Jake

2. **Decision**: Script extraction pattern for token reduction
   - **Rationale**: Separating bash scripts from prompts saves tokens
   - **Impact**: 92% reduction in some cases
   - **Time**: This session  
   - **Based On**: Token optimization research

3. **Decision**: Users never read prompt files
   - **Rationale**: Clear separation of concerns
   - **Impact**: Agents must communicate user actions
   - **Time**: This session
   - **Approved By**: Jake

#### Problems Encountered

- **Issue**: commit.md was too verbose (2.5k tokens)
  - **Status**: Resolved
  - **Approach**: Reduced to 750 tokens while preserving behavior
  - **GitHub Issue**: #371

#### User Communications

- Early: Jake identified need for one-time handover system
- Mid: Jake emphasized users don't read prompt files
- Late: Jake requested PR creation system based on commit analysis
- Current: Context save due to 16% remaining

### Understanding & Insights

#### Project Patterns

- One feature = One window = One agent
- Clear separation: prompts for agents, docs for users
- Script extraction dramatically reduces token usage
- Commit messages serve as detailed documentation
- PR bodies should analyze all commits, not just latest

#### Technical Context

- **Architecture**: Git worktrees enable branch isolation
- **Constraints**: Claude Code cannot cd outside original directory
- **Dependencies**: VS Code tasks, gh CLI for PRs
- **GitHub Integration**: PR creation leverages detailed commit messages

### Pending Items

#### Immediate Next Steps

1. Add and commit new PR creation files
2. Update PR #376 with latest changes
3. Ensure all tests pass

#### Waiting For

- PR review and merge

#### Questions/Concerns

- None - system is ready for use

### Git-Based Memory Status

- **Last Commit**: fad43f1 - chore: update prompt engineer memory
- **Uncommitted Changes**: PR creation files (create.md, generate-pr-body.sh)
- **Current Branch**: feature-draft-git-worktree-docs

### Environment State

- **Current Directory**: /Users/jakedetels/www/claude-github-apm/worktrees/feature-draft-git-worktree-docs
- **Active Branch**: feature-draft-git-worktree-docs
- **Modified Files**: 
  - src/prompts/git/pr/create.md (new)
  - scripts/git/generate-pr-body.sh (new)

### Handover Notes

If context is for handover:

- **Critical Information**: PR creation system complete and tested
- **Watch Out For**: Script needs to detect correct base branch
- **Recommended Approach**: Test with different branch scenarios
- **Key Files to Review**: 

```
DO NOT READ THESE FILES DURING INITIALIZATION
These files will only be read if/when the user chooses to resume this work:
- src/prompts/git/pr/create.md (complete PR creation guide)
- scripts/git/generate-pr-body.sh (automated PR body generator)
- src/prompts/git/worktrees/ (all handover system files)
```

## Recovery Instructions

To restore this context:

1. During initialization, read ONLY:
   - Your init files (generic + role-specific)
   - Your MEMORY.md
   - This context file
2. Present work options to user and wait for direction
3. If user chooses to resume:
   - Read the specific files listed above
   - Run `git status` to check for uncommitted changes
   - Review recent commits if needed
4. Continue with work as directed
