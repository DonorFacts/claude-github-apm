# Agent Context Snapshot

Generated: 2025-01-18T14:20:00Z
Agent Role: prompt-engineer
Agent Instance: Prompt_Engineer_v1

## Current State

### Role & Responsibilities

- **Primary Role**: Prompt architecture and agent capability design
- **Current Focus**: Simplifying memory system and creating agent initialization framework
- **Key Responsibilities**: Create agent prompts, optimize for clarity, maintain consistency

### Active Work

#### Current Task

- **Task ID**: Memory system simplification and documentation
- **Status**: completed
- **Started**: ~2 hours ago
- **Work Completed**: 
  - Created generic agent init system
  - Consolidated commands (removed 5 redundant prompts)
  - Updated memory to focus on principles vs events
  - Documented system in README
- **Work Remaining**: None for this task
- **Related Issues**: None tracked

#### Work in Progress

No active code development at this moment.

### Recent Context

#### Recent Git Commits

- 19180bb: docs: update README with agent memory and initialization info
- ef3754b: refactor: remove context-check and make monitoring automatic
- 16b6062: refactor: focus long-term memory on enduring principles
- 2f14bc4: feat: simplify memory system and consolidate commands
- 286bceb: fix: correct understanding of commit timing in long-term memory

#### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Consolidate to single context-save command
   - **Rationale**: Multiple save commands created confusion
   - **Impact**: Simpler system with one flexible command
   - **Time**: Today
   - **Approved By**: User

2. **Decision**: Make memory operations automatic
   - **Rationale**: Users shouldn't manage agent memory manually
   - **Impact**: Better UX, agents handle own memory
   - **Time**: Today
   - **Approved By**: User

3. **Decision**: Remove Evolution Logs from memory
   - **Rationale**: Event logs clutter memory, principles matter
   - **Impact**: Cleaner, more useful long-term memory
   - **Time**: Today
   - **Approved By**: User

#### Problems Encountered

- **Issue**: Initial misunderstanding of commit timing
  - **Status**: Resolved
  - **Approach**: Updated memory and now commit at start of responses

#### User Communications

Recent important exchanges:
- 14:15: User noted Evolution Logs were like short-term memory, not long-term
- 14:00: User questioned purpose of context-check command
- 13:45: User requested generic init prompt for all agents
- 13:00: User clarified commit timing (review before commit)

### Understanding & Insights

#### Project Patterns

- Three-tier memory system is working well
- Generic + specialized pattern for agent initialization
- Command consolidation improves usability
- Automatic behaviors better than manual commands

#### Technical Context

- **Architecture**: Agent prompts in src/prompts/agents/
- **Constraints**: Keep agent and user content separate
- **Dependencies**: All agents depend on generic init.md
- **GitHub Integration**: Not yet implemented for this session

### Pending Items

#### Immediate Next Steps

1. None - approaching context limit per user notification
2. New instance should continue prompt development work
3. Review created prompts in .claude/commands/ (still pending)

#### Waiting For

- None currently

#### Questions/Concerns

- Still need to review existing prompts in .claude/commands/
- More agent role prompts need to be created

### Git-Based Memory Status

- **Last Commit**: 19180bb - docs: update README
- **Uncommitted Changes**: None
- **Next Commit Plans**: N/A - context limit reached

### Environment State

- **Current Directory**: /Users/jakedetels/www/claude-github-apm
- **Open Files**: This context file being written
- **Modified Files**: None uncommitted
- **Active Branch**: feature/github-integration-build-system

### Handover Notes

If context is for handover:

- **Critical Information**: Memory system is now simplified to one context-save command
- **Watch Out For**: Agents must read src/prompts/agents/init.md first
- **Recommended Approach**: Continue creating more agent role prompts
- **Key Files to Review**: 
  - src/prompts/agents/init.md (generic initialization)
  - src/prompts/context-save.md (single save command)
  - apm/agents/prompt-engineer/MEMORY.md (my learnings)

## Recovery Instructions

To restore this context:

1. Load this context file from `apm/agents/prompt-engineer/context/latest.md`
2. Review recent git commits with `git log --oneline -10`
3. Check GitHub issues referenced in commits (none for this session)
4. Review any uncommitted changes with `git status`
5. Continue with reviewing .claude/commands/ prompts
