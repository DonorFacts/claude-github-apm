# Agent Context Snapshot

Generated: 2025-06-25T16:35:00Z
Agent Role: prompt-engineer
Agent Instance: Primary

## Current State

### Role & Responsibilities

- **Primary Role**: Prompt Engineer for Claude GitHub APM framework
- **Current Focus**: Git worktree documentation and handover system implementation
- **Key Responsibilities**: 
  - Designing and optimizing prompts for AI effectiveness
  - Creating clear documentation for agent workflows
  - Ensuring efficient context transfer between agents
  - Improving worktree handling patterns

### Active Work

#### Current Task

- **Task ID**: Git worktree documentation enhancement
- **Status**: in_progress
- **Started**: This session
- **Work Completed**:
  - Reorganized git worktree documentation into cleaner structure
  - Created handover template system for agent context transfer
  - Fixed cd command limitations in worktree scripts
  - Added date prefix for handover files (YYYY_MM_DD format)
  - Clarified current date usage to prevent copying example dates
- **Work Remaining**: Testing handover system in practice
- **Related Issues**: #371, PRs #374, #375

#### Work in Progress

All documentation changes have been committed and pushed. The handover system is ready for real-world testing.

### Recent Context

#### Recent Git Commits

- b139c8d: fix: clarify current date usage in handover file creation
- 99b9dab: feat: add worktree handover system for agent context transfer  
- d6f4b55: chore: remove archived git worktree documentation
- 68f3c32: refactor: reorganize git worktree documentation for clarity

#### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Reorganize worktree docs into create/troubleshoot/verify structure
   - **Rationale**: Cleaner navigation and clearer purpose for each file
   - **Impact**: Agents can find appropriate guidance more easily
   - **Time**: This session
   - **Approved By**: Jake

2. **Decision**: Use date prefix for handover files
   - **Rationale**: Better organization and avoiding conflicts
   - **Impact**: Handover files now use YYYY_MM_DD-<branch>.md format
   - **Time**: This session
   - **Approved By**: Jake

3. **Decision**: Remove TypeScript handover creation tool
   - **Rationale**: LLMs can generate handover files directly from template
   - **Impact**: Simpler workflow, less code to maintain
   - **Time**: This session
   - **Approved By**: Jake

#### Problems Encountered

- **Issue**: Agent used incorrect date from example (1/25/2025 instead of 6/25/2024)
  - **Status**: Resolved
  - **Approach**: Added explicit "TODAY'S date" warnings throughout docs
  - **GitHub Issue**: None - fixed in PR #375

#### User Communications

- Start: Jake identified missing handover file creation in worktree workflow
- Mid: Jake suggested date prefix format and emphasized current date usage
- Late: Jake pointed out over-engineering with TypeScript tool
- Current: Context save requested due to low context window (28%)

### Understanding & Insights

#### Project Patterns

- Simplicity is valued - TypeScript tools aren't needed when LLMs can handle it
- Clear, explicit instructions prevent misinterpretation (e.g., "TODAY'S date")
- Handover files are critical for multi-window agent coordination
- One feature = one window = one agent principle

#### Technical Context

- **Architecture**: Git worktrees enable branch isolation
- **Constraints**: Claude Code cannot cd outside original directory  
- **Dependencies**: VS Code integration, pnpm for dependencies
- **GitHub Integration**: Creating issues and PRs for documentation work

### Pending Items

#### Immediate Next Steps

1. Test handover system with real worktree creation
2. Verify agents properly read handover files on initialization
3. Monitor for any edge cases in production use

#### Waiting For

- PR reviews and merges (#374, #375)
- Real-world testing of handover system

#### Questions/Concerns

- None at this time - system is ready for testing

### Git-Based Memory Status

- **Last Commit**: b139c8d - fix: clarify current date usage in handover file creation
- **Uncommitted Changes**: None
- **Current Branch**: feature-draft-git-worktree-docs

### Environment State

- **Current Directory**: /Users/jakedetels/www/claude-github-apm/worktrees/feature-draft-git-worktree-docs
- **Active Branch**: feature-draft-git-worktree-docs
- **Modified Files**: None (all committed)

### Handover Notes

If context is for handover:

- **Critical Information**: Handover system is implemented and ready for testing
- **Watch Out For**: Agents must use current date, not example dates
- **Recommended Approach**: Follow the new worktree creation workflow in create.md
- **Key Files to Review**: 

```
DO NOT READ THESE FILES DURING INITIALIZATION
These files will only be read if/when the user chooses to resume this work:
- src/prompts/git/worktrees/create.md (main workflow documentation)
- src/prompts/git/worktrees/handover-template.md (template for handovers)
- src/prompts/git/worktrees/troubleshoot.md (edge cases)
- src/prompts/git/worktrees/verify.md (validation steps)
```

## Recovery Instructions

To restore this context:

1. During initialization, read ONLY:
   - Your init files (generic + role-specific)
   - Your MEMORY.md
   - This context file
2. Present work options to user and wait for direction
3. If user chooses to resume:
   - Read the specific files listed above
   - Run `git status` to check for uncommitted changes
   - Review recent commits if needed
4. Continue with work as directed
