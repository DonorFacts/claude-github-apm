# Agent Context Snapshot

Generated: 2025-06-29T22:15:00Z
Agent Role: prompt-engineer
Agent Instance: Primary

## Current State

### Role & Responsibilities

- **Primary Role**: APM Prompt Engineer Agent - Prompt design and optimization
- **Current Focus**: **COMPLETED** - Docker container integration for git worktrees
- **Key Responsibilities**: 
  - Design prompts for maximum AI effectiveness
  - Implement "vibe coding" guidance with structure
  - Optimize AI-human collaboration through strategic prompt design
  - Document prompt engineering patterns and insights

### Active Work

#### Current Task

- **Task ID**: Docker worktree integration debugging and resolution
- **Status**: **COMPLETED**
- **Started**: Previous session debugging workflow
- **Work Completed**: 
  - ✅ Identified and fixed three critical Docker integration issues
  - ✅ Enhanced Docker wrapper project root detection logic
  - ✅ Fixed container mount configuration and permissions
  - ✅ Committed Docker wrapper to git for worktree availability
  - ✅ Verified Docker integration working in production test
  - ✅ Cleaned up all debug artifacts
  - ✅ Created comprehensive documentation
- **Work Remaining**: None - Docker integration fully functional
- **Related Issues**: GitHub issues #392, #393, #394 (all resolved and closed)

#### Work in Progress

No active code development - session focused on debugging and system integration.

### Recent Context

#### Recent Git Commits

- 0e15a0d: fix: remove read-only flag from .claude.json mount
- d5be536: fix: add validation to Docker wrapper project root detection  
- 4100e96: fix: update Docker wrapper to handle main/worktrees project structure
- 9fb29a9: fix: update VS Code tasks.json to use Docker wrapper
- a4db3c4: feat: add Docker wrapper symlink for Claude Code containerization

#### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Commit Docker wrapper symlink to git
   - **Rationale**: Ensures all worktree branches have access to containerized Claude
   - **Impact**: Docker integration now works across all git worktrees
   - **Time**: Current session
   - **Approved By**: User (Jake)

2. **Decision**: Enhanced project root detection with validation
   - **Rationale**: Prevents false matches with worktree subdirectories containing project files
   - **Impact**: Docker wrapper correctly identifies true project root
   - **Time**: Current session
   - **Approved By**: User (Jake)

3. **Decision**: Remove read-only flag from .claude.json mount
   - **Rationale**: Claude Code requires write access for configuration
   - **Impact**: Eliminates EROFS errors in containerized environment
   - **Time**: Current session
   - **Approved By**: User (Jake)

#### Problems Encountered

- **Issue**: Docker wrapper not available in git worktrees
  - **Status**: **Resolved** - Committed symlink to git
  - **Approach**: Git commit ensures availability across all branches

- **Issue**: Incorrect project root detection in main/worktrees structure
  - **Status**: **Resolved** - Enhanced detection logic with validation
  - **Approach**: Two-pass detection prioritizing main/worktrees structure

- **Issue**: Container mount and permissions errors
  - **Status**: **Resolved** - Fixed mount configuration and removed read-only flags
  - **Approach**: Container recreation with correct filesystem access

#### User Communications

- User reported foreign characters and Docker integration not working
- User provided screenshots showing container errors and filesystem issues
- User confirmed final test showing Docker integration working correctly
- User requested all three tasks: cleanup, production test, documentation

### Understanding & Insights

#### Critical Docker Integration Breakthroughs

- **Root Cause Analysis**: Git worktrees use relative paths but Docker container working directory calculation was incorrect
- **Project Structure Understanding**: main/worktrees architecture requires specialized detection logic
- **Container Persistence Issue**: Long-running containers can have stale mount configurations
- **Permission Requirements**: Claude Code needs read-write access to configuration files

#### Technical Context

- **Architecture**: Transparent Docker containerization with PATH wrapper approach
- **Project Structure**: `/Users/jakedetels/www/claude-github-apm/` with main/ and worktrees/ subdirectories
- **Container Strategy**: Single persistent container with project root mount
- **Security Model**: Container isolation with controlled filesystem access

#### Project Patterns

- Jake values working implementations over theoretical solutions
- Jake expects systematic debugging and honest assessment of issues
- Jake appreciates comprehensive documentation of complex fixes
- Jake prefers all three tasks completed: fix, test, document

### Pending Items

#### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Context saved and documented** ✅
2. **Docker integration fully functional** ✅
3. **Ready for original prompt build optimization work** ✅

#### Waiting For

- No pending dependencies
- Docker integration complete and production-ready

#### Questions/Concerns

- None from current session
- Docker worktree integration successfully resolved

### Git-Based Memory Status

- **Last Commit**: 0e15a0d - fix: remove read-only flag from .claude.json mount
- **Uncommitted Changes**: docs/docker-worktree-integration-fix.md (documentation created)
- **Next Commit Plans**: Commit documentation file

### Environment State

- **Current Directory**: /Users/jakedetels/www/claude-github-apm/main (bash session had issues after cleanup)
- **Modified Files**: docs/docker-worktree-integration-fix.md (comprehensive documentation)
- **Active Branch**: main
- **Docker Status**: Container integration fully functional

### Handover Notes

**Critical Information**: 
- **MAJOR SUCCESS**: Docker container integration with git worktrees is now fully functional
- All three major issues identified and resolved systematically
- Comprehensive documentation created for future reference
- Original prompt build optimization task can now proceed in containerized environment

**Key Accomplishments**:
- Fixed Docker wrapper availability across all git worktrees
- Enhanced project root detection for main/worktrees structure
- Resolved container mount and permissions issues
- Verified production-ready Docker integration

**Files Modified During Session**:

```
DO NOT READ THESE FILES DURING INITIALIZATION
These files were created/modified during this debugging session:
- .local/bin/claude-container (enhanced project root detection)
- .local/bin/claude (symlink committed to git)  
- .vscode/tasks.json (updated to use Docker wrapper)
- docs/docker-worktree-integration-fix.md (comprehensive documentation)
```

**Work Status**: **COMPLETE** - Docker worktree integration fully resolved and documented

## Recovery Instructions

To restore this context:

1. During initialization, read ONLY:
   - Prompt Engineer init files
   - MEMORY.md for prompt-engineer role
   - This context file
2. Docker integration work is complete - ready for new tasks
3. Original prompt build optimization work can proceed in containerized environment
4. All documentation and fixes are in place for future reference

## Context Save Purpose

This save represents completion of a major debugging and integration effort. Docker container integration with git worktrees went from non-functional to production-ready through systematic problem-solving and comprehensive fixes.
