# Agent Context Snapshot

Generated: 2025-06-27T19:00:00Z
Agent Role: prompt-engineer
Agent Instance: Primary

## Current State

### Role & Responsibilities

- **Primary Role**: Prompt Engineer for Claude GitHub APM framework
- **Current Focus**: Docker security integration analysis and architecture decisions
- **Key Responsibilities**: 
  - Designing and optimizing prompts for AI effectiveness
  - Creating clear documentation for agent workflows
  - Token optimization and prompt conciseness
  - Architectural analysis for framework enhancements

### Active Work

#### Current Task

- **Task ID**: Complete Docker integration architecture analysis
- **Status**: pending - awaiting user decision on Manager-Worker pattern
- **Started**: This session continuation from Docker implementation
- **Work Completed**:
  - Successfully implemented basic Docker integration with claude-code-sandbox
  - Created working --docker flag for worktree creation
  - Identified fundamental architectural conflict between dev containers and APM framework
  - Analyzed UX implications of different Docker approaches
  - Proposed Manager-Worker pattern to preserve APM orchestration
- **Work Remaining**: 
  - Update documentation based on Manager-Worker architecture decision
  - Potentially refactor implementation if user approves new approach
- **Related Issues**: [#388](https://github.com/DonorFacts/claude-github-apm/issues/388)

#### Work in Progress

Current implementation in feature-draft-git-worktree-docs branch includes:
- Docker integration with --docker flag (may need revision)
- claude-code-sandbox configuration template
- Agent initialization updates for container detection
- Comprehensive Docker usage documentation

### Recent Context

#### Recent Git Commits

- 31bb63a: feat: implement Docker security integration for APM framework
- 6637c4b: feat: add Docker security integration planning for APM framework

#### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Implement Docker integration using claude-code-sandbox (not VS Code dev containers)
   - **Rationale**: Dev containers break APM's worktree orchestration model
   - **Impact**: Preserves ability to create/manage worktrees from any Claude instance
   - **Time**: Current session
   - **Status**: Under review - may need Manager-Worker pattern

2. **Decision**: Reject VS Code Dev Containers approach
   - **Rationale**: Would isolate Claude instances, breaking cross-worktree coordination
   - **Impact**: Maintains APM framework functionality
   - **Time**: Current session analysis
   - **Approved By**: Architectural analysis

3. **Decision**: Propose Manager-Worker pattern for Docker integration
   - **Rationale**: Preserves UX (VS Code terminal) while gaining security benefits
   - **Impact**: Host Claude orchestrates, Container Claude handles dangerous ops
   - **Time**: Current session
   - **Status**: Pending user approval

#### Problems Encountered

- **Issue**: Initial implementation used --docker flag, but user wants Docker as default
  - **Status**: Identified solution - make Docker default, remove flag
  - **Approach**: Update implementation to always use Docker for appropriate operations
  
- **Issue**: Confusion about whether to use claude-sandbox vs VS Code dev containers
  - **Status**: Resolved through architectural analysis
  - **Approach**: claude-sandbox preserves APM orchestration capabilities

- **Issue**: UX concern about web terminal vs VS Code terminal preference
  - **Status**: Addressed with Manager-Worker pattern proposal
  - **Approach**: Keep conversation in VS Code, delegate dangerous ops to background container

#### User Communications

- User correctly identified that Docker should be default, not optional
- User emphasized zero additional steps for optimal UX
- User strongly prefers VS Code terminal conversation over web browser
- User concerned about mental mapping between worktrees and Claude conversations
- User questions about Host vs Container Claude instances and VS Code + Docker workflows

### Understanding & Insights

#### Project Patterns

- Jake values seamless UX above technical complexity
- Workflow automation should be invisible to user
- Mental model consistency (one window = one branch = one conversation) is critical
- Default behaviors should be secure and fast, not require user decisions

#### Technical Context

- **Architecture**: APM framework requires host-level git operations for worktree management
- **Constraints**: Claude Code cannot cd outside original directory (worktree limitation)
- **Dependencies**: claude-code-sandbox, Docker, VS Code integration
- **GitHub Integration**: Automatic issue creation and PR management must remain functional

#### Critical Realizations

- VS Code Dev Containers would break APM's core value proposition
- User experience is more important than technical purity
- Docker security should enhance, not complicate, existing workflows
- Manager-Worker pattern may be necessary to satisfy both security and UX requirements

### Pending Items

#### Immediate Next Steps

1. Get user approval on Manager-Worker pattern vs current implementation
2. Update documentation to reflect architectural decisions
3. Potentially refactor implementation based on user feedback
4. Clarify when Host Claude vs Container Claude should be used

#### Waiting For

- User decision on Manager-Worker architecture approach
- Clarification on Docker as default vs optional behavior
- Guidance on balancing security isolation with UX simplicity

#### Questions/Concerns

- Is Manager-Worker pattern overcomplicating things?
- Should Docker be truly transparent to users?
- How to handle the handoff between Host and Container Claude instances?
- What operations actually require dangerous permissions vs workflow speed?

### Git-Based Memory Status

- **Last Commit**: 31bb63a - feat: implement Docker security integration for APM framework
- **Uncommitted Changes**: None currently
- **Next Commit Plans**: Update documentation and potentially implementation based on user decisions

### Environment State

- **Current Directory**: `/Users/jakedetels/www/claude-github-apm/worktrees/feature-draft-git-worktree-docs`
- **Active Branch**: feature-draft-git-worktree-docs
- **Modified Files**: None currently (implementation completed and committed)

### Handover Notes

If context is for handover:

- **Critical Information**: Docker integration is implemented but architecture needs user approval
- **Watch Out For**: Don't over-engineer the solution - user values simplicity over technical perfection
- **Recommended Approach**: Listen to user's UX preferences and adjust technical approach accordingly
- **Key Files to Review**: 

```
DO NOT READ THESE FILES DURING INITIALIZATION
These files will only be read if/when the user chooses to resume this work:
- docs/planning/simple-docker-integration.md (implementation plan)
- src/scripts/git/worktree-create.sh (current Docker implementation)
- src/config/apm-docker.config.json (Docker configuration template)
- docs/docker-usage.md (user documentation that may need updates)
- src/prompts/agents/init.md (container detection logic)
```

## Recovery Instructions

To restore this context:

1. During initialization, read ONLY:
   - Your init files (generic + role-specific)
   - Your MEMORY.md
   - This context file
2. Present work options to user and wait for direction
3. If user chooses to resume:
   - Review the architectural decision pending (Manager-Worker pattern)
   - Check current implementation status in feature branch
   - Ask user for guidance on Docker default behavior
   - Update documentation based on decisions
4. Continue with work as directed

## Key Architectural Question Pending

User feedback suggests current implementation may not meet UX requirements:
- Should Docker be default (not optional --docker flag)?
- Should Manager-Worker pattern be used to keep conversation in VS Code?
- How much complexity is acceptable for security benefits?

Next session should focus on resolving these architectural questions before proceeding with implementation updates.
