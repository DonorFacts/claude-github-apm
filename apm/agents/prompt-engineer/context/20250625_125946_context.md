# Prompt Engineer Context - 2025-06-25 12:59:46

## Session Summary
- **Branch**: feature-draft-git-worktree-docs
- **Role**: prompt-engineer
- **Context Usage**: 36% (low)
- **Primary Focus**: Token optimization research and implementation

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Token Impact Research
- Conducted comprehensive research on Claude Code tool call token impacts
- Discovered critical finding: **Every tool call adds 3-4 message entries** (~200-300 tokens each)
- Created detailed documentation at `docs/Claude-Code/token-impacts-from-tools-calls.md`
- Identified that tool calls are conversations, not free operations

### 2. Meta-Script Pattern Discovery
- Found that meta-scripts can reduce token usage by **85-95%**
- Example: 20+ individual calls â†’ 3 meta-script calls
- Documented pattern for future optimization efforts

### 3. Terminal Status Updates Optimization
- Updated `src/prompts/terminal/update-status.md` with:
  - Emoji-based visual indicators
  - Concise milestone-only updates
  - Token-efficient format
- Created `scripts/update-terminal-title.sh` for dynamic terminal titles

### 4. CLAUDE.md Script Path Fixes
- Corrected all script references to use relative paths
- Ensures portability across different worktrees
- Fixed state management approach (removed incorrect .claude/ usage)

## Important Learnings

### Token Optimization Insights
1. **Tool calls are expensive**: Each call creates multiple message entries
2. **Batch operations matter**: Combining operations saves significant tokens
3. **Meta-scripts are powerful**: Can achieve 85-95% token reduction
4. **Milestone updates only**: Avoid per-file status updates

### State Management Clarification
- The `.claude/` directory approach was incorrect
- Agent memory system (MEMORY.md + context saves) is the proper approach
- Context files provide handover capability between sessions

### Best Practices Discovered
1. Always batch related tool calls when possible
2. Use meta-scripts for repetitive operations
3. Keep terminal updates concise and milestone-based
4. Maintain relative paths in all script references

## Files Modified
- `docs/Claude-Code/token-impacts-from-tools-calls.md` (created)
- `src/prompts/terminal/update-status.md` (updated)
- `scripts/update-terminal-title.sh` (created)
- `CLAUDE.md` (updated script paths)

## Next Actions
1. Implement meta-script patterns in more areas
2. Create token usage monitoring tools
3. Document more optimization patterns
4. Train other agents on these findings

## Handover Notes
- All research findings are documented in detail
- Terminal update patterns are ready for use
- Token optimization strategies are proven and documented
- Agent memory system is clarified and properly used

## Related Issues
- Research on token impacts from tool calls
- Terminal status update optimization
- Script path portability fixes
