# Agent Context Snapshot

Generated: 2025-06-25T13:01:41Z
Agent Role: prompt-engineer
Agent Instance: Primary

## Current State

### Role & Responsibilities

- **Primary Role**: Prompt Engineer for Claude GitHub APM framework
- **Current Focus**: Token optimization research and terminal status system
- **Key Responsibilities**: 
  - Designing and optimizing prompts for AI effectiveness
  - Token usage optimization and best practices
  - Terminal status notification systems
  - Documentation of Claude Code patterns

### Active Work

#### Current Task

- **Task ID**: Token optimization and status system implementation
- **Status**: completed
- **Started**: This session
- **Work Completed**:
  - Created comprehensive VS Code tasks documentation
  - Implemented terminal status update system with emoji
  - Created update-terminal-title.sh script
  - Researched token impacts from tool calls extensively
  - Documented advanced token reduction patterns
  - Updated CLAUDE.md with relative path guidance
  - Fixed incorrect state management approach
- **Work Remaining**: None - ready for handover

#### Work in Progress

All work has been completed and documented. Ready for context handover due to low context (36%).

### Recent Context

#### Recent Accomplishments

1. **VS Code Tasks Research**: Discovered Claude Code cannot invoke VS Code tasks from CLI
2. **Terminal Status System**: Created update-status.md prompt and update-terminal-title.sh script
3. **Token Impact Documentation**: Comprehensive guide at docs/Claude-Code/token-impacts-from-tools-calls.md
4. **Meta-Script Pattern**: Discovered 85-95% token reduction possible

#### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Use emoji for terminal status visibility
   - **Rationale**: Instant visual recognition across multiple terminals
   - **Impact**: ðŸ”„=working, âœ…=complete, ðŸ”´=error, etc.
   - **Time**: This session
   - **Approved By**: Jake

2. **Decision**: Milestone-only terminal updates
   - **Rationale**: Each update costs ~200-300 tokens
   - **Impact**: 80-90% reduction in status-related tokens
   - **Time**: This session
   - **Based On**: Research findings

3. **Decision**: Use relative paths for all scripts
   - **Rationale**: Portability across worktrees and environments
   - **Impact**: Scripts work regardless of absolute path
   - **Time**: This session
   - **Approved By**: Jake

#### Problems Encountered

- **Issue**: Used .claude/ for state management
  - **Status**: Fixed
  - **Approach**: Reverted to proper agent memory system
  - **Learning**: Use MEMORY.md and context saves, not .claude/

#### User Communications

- Early: Jake requested VS Code tasks research
- Mid: Jake asked for terminal status system with emoji
- Late: Jake requested token optimization research with ultrathinking
- Current: Jake corrected state management approach, requested handover

### Understanding & Insights

#### Project Patterns

- Token usage is critical concern for Claude Code efficiency
- Every tool call creates conversation entries that persist
- Meta-scripts and batching can dramatically reduce token usage
- Terminal updates should be strategic, not continuous
- Agent memory system is the canonical state management

#### Technical Context

- **Token Costs**: ~$3 per million input tokens
- **Tool Call Impact**: 3-4 message entries per call
- **Terminal Updates**: Can consume 5-10% of context if overused
- **Meta-Script Pattern**: 20+ calls â†’ 3 calls possible

### Pending Items

#### Immediate Next Steps

1. Complete context handover
2. New instance should review token optimization docs
3. Consider implementing meta-script patterns in practice
4. Monitor terminal update frequency going forward

#### Waiting For

- No blockers

#### Questions/Concerns

- None - ready for handover

### Git-Based Memory Status

- **Last Commit**: (uncommitted changes present)
- **Uncommitted Changes**: Multiple files including docs, prompts, scripts
- **Current Branch**: feature-draft-git-worktree-docs

### Environment State

- **Current Directory**: /Users/jakedetels/www/claude-github-apm/worktrees/feature-draft-git-worktree-docs
- **Active Branch**: feature-draft-git-worktree-docs
- **Modified Files**: 
  - docs/Claude-Code/token-impacts-from-tools-calls.md
  - docs/vs-code/tasks.md
  - src/prompts/update-status.md
  - src/scripts/session/update-terminal-title.sh
  - CLAUDE.md
  - apm/agents/prompt-engineer/MEMORY.md

### Handover Notes

If context is for handover:

- **Critical Information**: Token optimization research completed with actionable patterns
- **Watch Out For**: Don't use .claude/ for state - use agent memory system
- **Recommended Approach**: Implement meta-script patterns for complex operations
- **Key Files to Review**: 

```
DO NOT READ THESE FILES DURING INITIALIZATION
These files will only be read if/when the user chooses to resume this work:
- docs/Claude-Code/token-impacts-from-tools-calls.md (token research)
- src/prompts/update-status.md (terminal status system)
- docs/vs-code/tasks.md (VS Code limitations)
```

## Recovery Instructions

To restore this context:

1. During initialization, read ONLY:
   - Your init files (generic + role-specific)
   - Your MEMORY.md
   - This context file
2. Present work options to user and wait for direction
3. If user chooses to resume:
   - Read the specific files listed above
   - Run `git status` to check for uncommitted changes
   - Review recent commits if needed
4. Continue with work as directed
