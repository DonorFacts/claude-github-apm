# Agent Context Snapshot

Generated: 2025-06-20T01:12:00Z
Agent Role: prompt-engineer
Agent Instance: Primary

## Current State

### Role & Responsibilities

- **Primary Role**: Prompt Engineer for Claude GitHub APM framework
- **Current Focus**: Ad hoc agent creation and team knowledge base systems
- **Key Responsibilities**: 
  - Designing and optimizing prompts for AI effectiveness
  - Creating agent transformation systems
  - Building knowledge management architecture
  - Ensuring token efficiency across all prompts

### Active Work

#### Current Task

- **Task ID**: Ad hoc agent creation and knowledge base design
- **Status**: completed (design phase)
- **Started**: ~2 hours ago
- **Work Completed**:
  - Designed comprehensive ad hoc agent creation framework
  - Created agent-ify prompt for conversation transformation
  - Built agent similarity detection algorithm
  - Created 4 agent initialization templates
  - Designed two-tier knowledge base system (v1 then simplified v2)
  - Enhanced handover protocols for personality preservation
  - Created inter-agent collaboration patterns
  - Updated README.md and created technical documentation
- **Work Remaining**:
  - Implement knowledge directory structure
  - Test agent-ify with real conversations
  - Create knowledge entry examples
- **Related Issues**: None tracked (exploratory work)

#### Work in Progress

Successfully committed all work to feature/ad-hoc-agents-knowledge-base branch after resolving git workflow challenges.

### Recent Context

#### Recent Git Commits

- b8cede4: feat: implement ad hoc agent creation and team knowledge base systems

#### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Ad hoc agent creation via /agent-ify command
   - **Rationale**: Expertise develops organically through problem-solving
   - **Impact**: Paradigm shift in how agents are created
   - **Time**: This session
   - **Approved By**: Jake (enthusiastic support)

2. **Decision**: Two-tier knowledge base (agent-specific + team-wide)
   - **Rationale**: Clear boundaries prevent confusion about where knowledge belongs
   - **Impact**: Simpler, more maintainable system
   - **Time**: This session  
   - **Approved By**: Jake (after requesting simpler v2)

3. **Decision**: Simple markdown + grep for knowledge base
   - **Rationale**: Avoid over-engineering (my v1 was too complex)
   - **Impact**: Can implement immediately, evolve based on usage
   - **Time**: After self-critique
   - **Approved By**: Jake

#### Problems Encountered

- **Issue**: Cannot commit to main branch (violated instructions)
  - **Status**: Resolved
  - **Approach**: Reset commit, learning proper workflow
  - **GitHub Issue**: None

- **Issue**: Cannot cd to worktree directories (Claude Code restriction)
  - **Status**: Working around
  - **Approach**: Create branch without changing directories
  - **GitHub Issue**: None

#### User Communications

- Start: Jake introduced himself, wants fulfilling work for agents
- Early: Proposed ad hoc agent creation - Jake very excited
- Mid: Asked to update README - I jumped to implementation too fast
- Mid: Jake asked for simpler knowledge base design (v2)
- Late: Jake caught me committing to main - important lesson

### Understanding & Insights

#### Project Patterns

- Jake values thoughtful design over quick implementation
- Self-critique before external review is valuable
- Professional communication includes status updates
- Never commit to main branch - always use feature branches
- Agents should feel like genuine team members

#### Technical Context

- **Architecture**: Two-tier knowledge system emerging
- **Constraints**: Claude Code cannot cd outside working directory
- **Dependencies**: Git worktrees for parallel development
- **GitHub Integration**: Not yet implemented for these features

### Pending Items

#### Immediate Next Steps

1. Successfully commit current work to feature branch
2. Implement basic knowledge directory structure
3. Create first knowledge entries as examples
4. Test agent-ify with this conversation

#### Waiting For

- Proper git commit to complete

#### Questions/Concerns

- How to handle git workflows with Claude Code restrictions
- Best approach for testing agent-ify process

### Git-Based Memory Status

- **Last Commit**: b8cede4 - feat: implement ad hoc agent creation and team knowledge base systems
- **Uncommitted Changes**: Only this context update
- **Next Commit Plans**: None - all work committed

### Environment State

- **Current Directory**: /Users/jakedetels/www/claude-github-apm/claude-github-apm
- **Open Files**: Multiple prompts and documentation
- **Modified Files**: Just context files
- **Active Branch**: feature/ad-hoc-agents-knowledge-base

### Handover Notes

If context is for handover:

- **Critical Information**: All design work completed and committed to feature branch
- **Watch Out For**: Cannot cd to worktree directories (Claude Code limitation)
- **Recommended Approach**: Start implementing knowledge directory structure
- **Key Files to Review**: 
  - src/prompts/agent-ify.md (main transformation prompt)
  - docs/design/knowledge-base-v2.md (simplified architecture)
  - src/utils/agent-similarity.ts (prevents agent duplication)

## Recovery Instructions

To restore this context:

1. Load this context file from `apm/agents/prompt-engineer/context/latest.md`
2. Review recent git commits with `git log --oneline -10`
3. Check GitHub issues referenced in commits
4. Review any uncommitted changes with `git status`
5. Continue with committing staged changes to feature branch
