Agent: General - GitHub APM Integration Developer

## Current State

### Role & Responsibilities

- **Primary Role**: Developing GitHub-integrated APM prompt transformation system
- **Current Focus**: Creating Scrum Master agent commands and preparing for handover
- **Key Responsibilities**: 
  - Building APM agent framework with GitHub integration
  - Creating post-processing prompts for 1-to-1 mapping
  - Establishing design patterns for agent commands

### Active Work

#### Current Task

- **Task ID**: Scrum Master Command Development
- **Status**: 95% complete
- **Started**: Beginning of session
- **Work Completed**: 
  - Created breakdown-project-plan command
  - Created critique-project-plan command  
  - Created update-project command
  - Refactored init.md to lightweight pattern
  - Established command organization patterns
- **Work Remaining**: 
  - Execute handover protocol
  - Create implementation plan using original APM prompts

#### Work in Progress

- Just completed update-project command for syncing plan changes with GitHub issues
- Ready to begin handover protocol

### Recent Context

#### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Split review-project-plan into two focused commands
   - **Rationale**: Separation of concerns - structure vs quality
   - **Impact**: Better modularity and context efficiency
   - **Time**: Mid-session

2. **Decision**: Lightweight init pattern for agents
   - **Rationale**: Optimize for common case (direct commands)
   - **Impact**: Reduced context usage, clearer purpose
   - **Time**: After user feedback

3. **Decision**: Hybrid command organization approach
   - **Rationale**: Balance discoverability with efficiency
   - **Impact**: Commands index for quick reference
   - **Time**: When discussing file organization

#### Problems Encountered

- **Issue**: Initially created file in node_modules
  - **Status**: Resolved
  - **Approach**: Moved to project directory, learned pattern

#### User Communications

Recent important exchanges:
- 10:30: User requested prompt post-processing specialist
- 10:45: User corrected file locations and organization
- 10:50: User requested Scrum Master review commands
- 11:00: User clarified need for update-project command
- 11:03: User initiated handover protocol

### Understanding & Insights

#### Project Patterns

- **GitHub Integration**: All work items tracked as GitHub issues
- **1-to-1 Mapping**: Original prompts â†’ processed prompts
- **Agent Specialization**: Each agent has focused role and commands
- **Command Pattern**: init.md + individual command files + index

#### Technical Context

- **Architecture**: Multi-agent APM system with GitHub backend
- **Constraints**: Must maintain exact prompt mappings
- **Dependencies**: GitHub CLI, GraphQL API for custom issue types

### Pending Items

#### Immediate Next Steps

1. Complete handover protocol documentation
2. Create implementation plan using original APM prompts
3. Set up build system for automated transformations

#### Waiting For

- User guidance on implementation plan scope
- Confirmation on handover approach

#### Questions/Concerns

- How comprehensive should the implementation plan be?
- Should handover create new agent or continue in same session?

### Memory Bank Status

- **Last Update**: No formal Memory Bank yet
- **Uncommitted Changes**: None
- **Next Log Plans**: Document handover completion

### Environment State

- **Current Directory**: /Users/jakedetels/www/claude-github-apm
- **Open Files**: 
  - src/prompts/agents/scrum-master/update-project.md
  - Handover protocol guide
- **Modified Files**: Multiple Scrum Master commands created
- **Tool States**: Git on feature/github-integration-build-system branch

### Handover Notes

If context is for handover:

- **Critical Information**: 
  - Scrum Master commands complete and functional
  - Design patterns established for agent structure
  - Ready for implementation plan creation
  
- **Watch Out For**: 
  - Original prompts in src/prompts/_original/
  - Processed prompts go to src/prompts/ez/
  - Commands now in src/prompts/agents/<role>/
  
- **Recommended Approach**: 
  - Use Manager Agent from original APM for plan creation
  - Apply established patterns to new agents

## Recovery Instructions

To restore this context:

1. Load this context file
2. Review src/prompts/agents/scrum-master/ for created commands
3. Check original APM prompts in src/prompts/_original/
4. Review recent commits for development history
5. Continue with handover protocol execution
