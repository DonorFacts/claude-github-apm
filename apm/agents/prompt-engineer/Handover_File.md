# APM Handover File - Claude GitHub APM Integration - 2025-01-16

## Section 1: Handover Overview

*   **Outgoing Agent ID:** Prompt_Engineer_Specialist_v1
*   **Incoming Agent ID:** TBD (Next Prompt Engineer or Manager Agent)
*   **Reason for Handover:** Context approaching operational limits after extensive prompt creation work
*   **Memory Bank Configuration:**
    *   **Note:** This project uses git commits as memory system (see `.claude/commands/commit.md`)
    *   **Traditional Memory Bank:** Not in use - replaced by git-based tracking
*   **Brief Project Status Summary:** GitHub-integrated APM system with custom agent prompts created. Scrum Master agent designed for Implementation Plan to GitHub issue conversion. Git commit-based memory system established.

## Section 2: Project Goal & Current Objectives (Relevant Scope)

The project goal is to create a GitHub-integrated APM (Agentic Project Management) system that automates project management through specialized Claude Code agents. Current objectives include:
- Establishing agent initialization prompts for various roles
- Creating command-specific prompts for agent operations
- Integrating GitHub's custom issue types with APM workflow
- Replacing traditional Memory Bank with git commit-based tracking

## Section 3: Implementation Plan Status (Relevant Scope)

*   **Link to Main Plan:** No formal Implementation Plan exists yet for this meta-project
*   **Current Phase/Focus:** Agent Prompt Engineering and System Design
*   **Completed Tasks (within current scope or recently):**
    *   Created git commit guide (`.claude/commands/commit.md`) - Status: Completed
    *   Designed Scrum Master agent initialization prompt - Status: Completed
    *   Created create-project-issues command prompt - Status: Completed
    *   Optimized prompt lengths for effectiveness - Status: Completed
*   **Tasks In Progress (within current scope):**
    *   Handover protocol preparation - **Assigned Agent(s):** Prompt_Engineer - **Current Status:** Creating handover artifacts
*   **Upcoming Tasks (immediate next relevant to scope):**
    *   Continue developing additional agent command prompts
    *   Test Scrum Master agent with real Implementation Plans
    *   Create more specialized agent roles as needed
*   **Deviations/Changes from Plan (Relevant Scope):** Replaced Memory Bank concept with git commits as primary tracking mechanism

## Section 4: Key Decisions & Rationale Log (Relevant Scope)

*   **Decision:** Replace Memory Bank with git commits - **Rationale:** Git provides natural version control and history tracking - **Approved By:** User - **Date:** 2025-01-16
*   **Decision:** Use GitHub custom issue types instead of labels - **Rationale:** Organization has configured custom types at org level - **Approved By:** User - **Date:** 2025-01-16
*   **Decision:** Create Scrum Master as specialized agent role - **Rationale:** Need dedicated agent for GitHub issue management - **Approved By:** User - **Date:** 2025-01-16
*   **Decision:** Optimize prompts to 2/3 original length - **Rationale:** Balance comprehensive guidance with conciseness - **Approved By:** User - **Date:** 2025-01-16

## Section 5: Active Agent Roster & Current Assignments (Manager Handovers)

*   **Prompt Engineer Specialist:** Current (this instance) - preparing for handover
*   **Future Scrum Master Agent:** To be initialized using created prompts
*   **Future Implementation Agents:** To be initialized as needed

## Section 6: Recent Memory Bank Entries (Contextual Snippets - Highly Relevant Scope)

Since this project uses git commits instead of traditional Memory Bank, relevant recent work includes:
- Creation of `.claude/commands/commit.md` - Git-based memory system guide
- Creation of `.claude/commands/agents/init-scrum-master.md` - Scrum Master initialization
- Creation of `.claude/commands/agents/scrum-master/create-project-issues.md` - Issue creation command

## Section 7: Recent Conversational Context & Key User Directives

**Recent User Directives:**
*   User requested removal of Memory Bank references in favor of git commits
*   User specified GitHub issue hierarchy must include all levels (Phase → Project → Epic → Task)
*   User clarified that custom issue types (not labels) should be used via GraphQL API
*   User requested Scrum Master prompt be condensed to 2/3 original length
*   User initiated handover protocol preparation
*   User wants Scrum Master to create organization project if none exists matching repo name
*   User emphasized frequent commits (potentially after every Claude Code reply)

## Section 8: Critical Code Snippets / Configuration / Outputs (Relevant Scope)

```bash
# GitHub GraphQL query for custom issue types
gh api graphql -H "GraphQL-Features: issue_types" -f query='
  query {
    organization(login: "ORG") {
      issueTypes(first: 20) {
        nodes { id name }
      }
    }
  }'

# Create issue with custom type
gh api graphql -H "GraphQL-Features: issue_types" -f query='
  mutation {
    createIssue(input: {
      repositoryId: "REPO_ID"
      title: "Title"
      body: "Body"
      issueTypeId: "TYPE_ID"
    }) {
      issue { number }
    }
  }'
```

## Section 9: Current Obstacles, Challenges & Risks (Relevant Scope)

*   **Technical Challenge:** GitHub custom issue types are in preview - **Status:** Documented requirements in prompts
*   **Potential Risk:** GraphQL complexity for issue creation may confuse agents - **Mitigation:** Provided clear examples in prompts

## Section 10: Outstanding User/Manager Directives or Questions (Relevant Scope)

*   Complete handover protocol following APM guidelines
*   Prepare incoming agent to continue prompt engineering work
