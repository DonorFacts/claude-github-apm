   - **Rationale**: Better real-time synchronization, WebSocket support, image handling capabilities
   - **Impact**: More robust architecture but requires network configuration
   - **Time**: 2025-07-02T21:15:00Z
   - **Approved By**: Jake (user)

2. **Decision**: Bind service to 0.0.0.0 instead of 127.0.0.1
   - **Rationale**: Allows Docker containers to access via host.docker.internal
   - **Impact**: Enables proper container → host communication
   - **Time**: 2025-07-02T21:30:00Z
   - **Approved By**: Jake (user)

3. **Decision**: Focus on terminal injection approach for Claude Code image input
   - **Rationale**: Maintains Claude Code's agent context while adding image capability
   - **Impact**: Most promising path forward among 3 identified options
   - **Time**: 2025-07-02T21:45:00Z
   - **Approved By**: Jake (user)

>>>>>>> 5d3291809a761e16acb51670a9738c3d2d31485f

### Understanding & Insights

#### Project Patterns

<<<<<<< HEAD
- **TDD Methodology**: Jake insists on comprehensive TDD approach - write tests first, implement second
- **Environment Awareness**: Solutions must work across host and container environments seamlessly
- **Research-Driven Development**: Thorough investigation of existing solutions before implementing custom ones

#### Technical Context

- **Architecture**: Container-based development environment with host clipboard access needs
- **Constraints**: Claude Code CLI has limited programmatic APIs, especially for image input
- **Dependencies**: macOS AppleScript for clipboard, Docker for containerization, Claude Code for AI interaction
- **Core Problem**: Need to bridge gap between container environment and host clipboard, then inject into Claude Code programmatically
=======
- **Container-first architecture**: Requiring container mode eliminates architectural complexity
- **Agent-specific directories**: Using `apm/agents/<role>/` improves organization
- **Single source of truth**: Handover files should exist in one location only
- **Test-driven validation**: Created multiple test worktrees to validate fixes

#### Technical Context

- **Architecture**: APM framework with multi-agent coordination via handover files
- **Constraints**: Claude Code cannot cd outside main directory, container paths differ from host
- **Dependencies**: Docker, VS Code integration, git worktree functionality
- **GitHub Integration**: Issue tracking for worktree testing

### Environment State

- **Current Directory**: /Users/jakedetels/www/claude-github-apm/main
<<<<<<< HEAD
- **Active Branch**: main
- **Modified Files**: Multiple clipboard-bridge related files with significant enhancements

### Research Findings

#### Claude Code Image Input Analysis

**Current State**: Claude Code has no programmatic image input APIs
- ✅ Interactive Ctrl+V works (with platform issues)
- ❌ No CLI flags for image attachment
- ❌ No SDK methods for programmatic image input
- ❌ No MCP server examples for image handling

**Claude Code's Approach**: 
- Uses temporary files on macOS (race condition issues)
- No compression - "dumps everything into context window"
- 90% failure rate due to temp file accessibility problems
- Generally broken and primitive implementation

#### Identified Solutions

**Option 1: Terminal Injection (Most Promising)**
- Use xdotool to simulate Ctrl+V keystrokes
- Pros: Maintains Claude Code context and agent capabilities
- Cons: X11 only, some apps reject synthetic events, requires window focus

**Option 2: Direct Anthropic API**
- Bypass Claude Code entirely, call API directly with base64 images
- Pros: Full control, guaranteed to work, proper compression possible
- Cons: Lose Claude Code's agent capabilities and codebase awareness

**Option 3: Custom MCP Server**
- Create MCP server that receives images and calls Anthropic API
- Pros: Integrates with Claude Code ecosystem
- Cons: Complex, unclear if image input is supported in MCP protocol
=======
- **Open Files**: None requiring attention
- **Modified Files**: None uncommitted
- **Active Branch**: main

### Handover Notes

**Critical Information**: 
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Clipboard bridge service is implemented and working for text
- Image capture from macOS clipboard is fixed with new AppleScript approach
- Container → host connectivity is working via host.docker.internal:41073
- Main blocker is programmatic image injection into Claude Code instance

**Watch Out For**: 
- AppleScript permissions on macOS (may require user approval)
- xdotool compatibility issues on different systems
- Context window limits with large base64 images

**Recommended Approach**: 
1. First investigate snap-happy app for inspiration/solutions
2. Prototype xdotool terminal injection with simple test case
3. Consider implementing smart image compression before injection

**Key Files to Review**:

```
DO NOT READ THESE FILES DURING INITIALIZATION
These files will only be read if/when the user chooses to resume this work:
- src/tools/clipboard-bridge/service.ts (lines 360-417: new AppleScript implementation)
- src/tools/clipboard-bridge/client.ts (lines 50-78: environment detection)

- src/scripts/paste-clipboard-enhanced.ts (debug logging additions)
- src/scripts/watch-all.sh (HTTP service integration)
- src/tools/clipboard-bridge/test-container-connectivity.ts (connectivity testing)
```

**Next Research Priority**: https://github.com/badlogic/lemmy/blob/main/apps/snap-happy/README.md
=======
- Worktree workflow now requires container environment from start
- Handover files moved to agent-specific directories only
- Path handling simplified by container requirement
- Multiple test worktrees created and validated

**Watch Out For**: 
- Users attempting worktree workflows from host environment (will fail with clear error)
- Need to start Claude Code in container mode for worktree functionality

**Recommended Approach**: 
- Continue using container-required workflow for all worktree operations
- Follow updated create.md for consistent worktree creation
- Agent-specific handover directories are now the standard

**Key Files Modified**: 
- src/prompts/git/worktrees/create.md (updated with container requirements)
- src/scripts/git-worktree/create-handover.sh (simplified for container-only)
- src/scripts/git-worktree/check-handover.sh (container validation and agent paths)

**Test Worktrees Created**:
- feature-395-test-worktree-creation
- feature-396-test-worktree-validation  
- test-worktree-final-validation

**Work Completed**: Worktree system improvements are complete and tested
