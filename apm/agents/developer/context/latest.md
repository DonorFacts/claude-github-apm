Agent Role: developer
Agent Instance: APM Collective Intelligence Implementation

## Current State

### Role & Responsibilities

- **Primary Role**: Developer implementing APM Collective Intelligence architecture
- **Current Focus**: Crash recovery system foundation - session tracking and CLI
- **Key Responsibilities**: 
  - Build session registry and heartbeat tracking
  - Implement APM CLI for session management
  - Create crash detection and recovery mechanisms
  - Follow TDD practices and maintain existing repo structure

### Active Work

#### Current Task

- **Task ID**: APM Multi-Agent Memory Architecture - Hour 1 Implementation
- **Status**: completed
- **Started**: 2025-07-01T22:00:00Z
- **Work Completed**:
  - Built complete APM CLI foundation (`src/scripts/apm/apm`)
  - Implemented session registry system with JSON storage
  - Created heartbeat tracking and staleness detection
  - Built list command with active/crashed session filtering
  - Created comprehensive demo plan and supporting scripts
  - Moved scripts to proper `src/scripts/` location per repo conventions
- **Work Remaining**: Recovery commands, VS Code integration, conversation search
- **Related Issues**: APM Multi-Agent Memory Architecture

#### Work in Progress

Session registry working with external storage:
- Sessions tracked in `../apm/sessions/registry.json`
- Automatic staleness detection (>2 minutes = crashed)
- Rich metadata: role, specialization, worktree, branch, timestamps

### Recent Context

#### Recent Git Commits

- 4c9a6da: feat: complete APM Collective Intelligence architecture design
- 356ac14: docs: consolidate architecture docs and preserve insights

#### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Use external storage (`../apm/`) for large conversations, repo storage (`./apm/`) for committed knowledge
   - **Rationale**: Conversations too large for repo, but memories/summaries should be committed
   - **Impact**: Clean separation of transient vs persistent data
   - **Time**: During architecture review
   - **Approved By**: Jake (user feedback)

2. **Decision**: Move scripts from `apm/scripts/` to `src/scripts/apm/`
   - **Rationale**: Follow existing repo conventions, keep source code in src/
   - **Impact**: Maintains clean project structure
   - **Time**: During demo creation
   - **Approved By**: Jake (explicit instruction)

3. **Decision**: Use JSON for session registry with jq processing
   - **Rationale**: Human-readable, shell-friendly, simple to implement
   - **Impact**: Easy debugging and manual inspection
   - **Time**: During CLI implementation
   - **Based On**: Technical simplicity for Day 1 implementation

#### Problems Encountered

- **Issue**: Original handover system had path detection issues in containers
  - **Status**: Resolved
  - **Approach**: Required container mode and simplified path logic
  - **GitHub Issue**: Issues #395, #396 for testing

#### User Communications

Recent important exchanges:
- User identified path mismatch between container and host environments
- User suggested requiring container mode from start to simplify architecture
- User requested handover files only in worktree directories, not duplicated
- User confirmed the simplified approach worked correctly

### Understanding & Insights

#### Project Patterns

- **Container-first architecture**: Requiring container mode eliminates architectural complexity
- **Agent-specific directories**: Using `apm/agents/<role>/` improves organization
- **Single source of truth**: Handover files should exist in one location only
- **Test-driven validation**: Created multiple test worktrees to validate fixes

#### Technical Context

- **Architecture**: APM framework with multi-agent coordination via handover files
- **Constraints**: Claude Code cannot cd outside main directory, container paths differ from host
- **Dependencies**: Docker, VS Code integration, git worktree functionality
- **GitHub Integration**: Issue tracking for worktree testing

### Pending Items

#### Immediate Next Steps

1. No immediate development tasks pending
2. Worktree system is now stable and container-validated
3. Ready for new feature development or maintenance tasks

#### Waiting For

- No pending dependencies
- System ready for production use

#### Questions/Concerns

- None from current session
- Worktree workflow appears robust with container requirement

### Git-Based Memory Status

- **Last Commit**: c9dab16 feat: require container environment for worktree workflows
- **Uncommitted Changes**: None (all changes committed)
- **Next Commit Plans**: None pending for current work

### Environment State

- **Current Directory**: /Users/jakedetels/www/claude-github-apm/main
- **Open Files**: None requiring attention
- **Modified Files**: None uncommitted
- **Active Branch**: main

### Handover Notes

**Critical Information**: 
- Worktree workflow now requires container environment from start
- Handover files moved to agent-specific directories only
- Path handling simplified by container requirement
- Multiple test worktrees created and validated

**Watch Out For**: 
- Users attempting worktree workflows from host environment (will fail with clear error)
- Need to start Claude Code in container mode for worktree functionality

**Recommended Approach**: 
- Continue using container-required workflow for all worktree operations
- Follow updated create.md for consistent worktree creation
- Agent-specific handover directories are now the standard

**Key Files Modified**: 
- src/prompts/git/worktrees/create.md (updated with container requirements)
- src/scripts/git-worktree/create-handover.sh (simplified for container-only)
- src/scripts/git-worktree/check-handover.sh (container validation and agent paths)

**Test Worktrees Created**:
- feature-395-test-worktree-creation
- feature-396-test-worktree-validation  
- test-worktree-final-validation

**Work Completed**: Worktree system improvements are complete and tested

## Recovery Instructions

To restore this context:

1. During initialization, read ONLY:
   - APM Master Developer Agent init files
   - MEMORY.md for developer role
   - This context file
2. Present work options to user and wait for direction
3. Framework is in excellent state - ready for new feature development
4. If user wants to review worktree changes, they're all committed in git history
5. Continue with new work as directed

## Context Save Purpose

This save represents completion of major worktree workflow improvements. The system now requires container environment for predictable operation and uses agent-specific directories for better organization. Framework is stable and ready for production use.
