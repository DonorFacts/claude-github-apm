# Agent Context Snapshot

Generated: 2025-06-29T17:30:00Z
Agent Role: developer
Agent Instance: APM Master Developer

## Current State

### Role & Responsibilities

- **Primary Role**: APM Master Developer - implementing features, fixing bugs, maintaining code quality
- **Current Focus**: Docker containerization implementation
- **Key Responsibilities**: Feature implementation, bug resolution, code quality, performance optimization, security implementation, documentation

### Active Work

#### Current Task

- **Task ID**: Docker single-container implementation
- **Status**: completed
- **Started**: 2025-06-29T08:00:00Z
- **Work Completed**: 
  - Implemented single-container Docker architecture
  - Created TypeScript container management system
  - Updated Dockerfile for dynamic user mapping
  - Added npm scripts for container management
  - Fixed root user permission issues
  - Updated all documentation
- **Work Remaining**: None for this task
- **Related Issues**: None (feature branch work)

#### Work in Progress

All Docker implementation work has been completed and committed.

### Recent Context

#### Recent Git Commits

- 4d29ef6: feat: implement single-container Docker architecture
  - Major refactor from multi-container to single-container approach
  - Created TypeScript container management script
  - Updated Dockerfile and documentation

#### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Single-container architecture instead of multi-container
   - **Rationale**: Simpler resource management, easier multi-agent collaboration, reduced complexity
   - **Impact**: All agents share one persistent container
   - **Time**: 2025-06-29
   - **Approved By**: Jake (user direction)

2. **Decision**: Dynamic user mapping instead of hardcoded UIDs
   - **Rationale**: Avoid permission issues across different systems
   - **Impact**: Container runs as host user dynamically
   - **Time**: 2025-06-29
   - **Approved By**: Jake (user concern about hardcoded UIDs)

#### Problems Encountered

- **Issue**: Claude Code refuses to run with --dangerously-skip-permissions as root
  - **Status**: Resolved
  - **Approach**: Implemented dynamic user mapping to run as host user
  - **GitHub Issue**: None

- **Issue**: Container health checks failing with "exited" status
  - **Status**: Resolved
  - **Approach**: Improved status handling and wait logic in container manager

#### User Communications

- 2025-06-29T08:00:00Z: User requested Docker documentation review
- 2025-06-29T09:00:00Z: User directed implementation of tasks 1, 4, and 5
- 2025-06-29T16:00:00Z: User raised concern about hardcoded UIDs
- 2025-06-29T17:00:00Z: User requested context save and commit

### Understanding & Insights

#### Project Patterns

- TypeScript preferred over bash for complex scripts
- Single shared resources preferred over distributed complexity
- Dynamic configuration preferred over hardcoded values
- Test-driven development required for all features

#### Technical Context

- **Architecture**: Single-container Docker serving all agents
- **Constraints**: Must support VS Code terminal workflow
- **Dependencies**: Docker Desktop, pnpm, TypeScript
- **GitHub Integration**: Not used for this implementation

### Pending Items

#### Immediate Next Steps

1. Save context (in progress)
2. Update long-term memory
3. Commit remaining changes

#### Waiting For

None

#### Questions/Concerns

### Handover Notes

Not a handover - session continuation.

**Key Docker Implementation Details**:
- Container name: `apm-workspace`
- Image: `apm-claude-container:latest`
- Management script: `src/scripts/docker/apm-container.ts`
- Entry point: `pnpm claude`

DO NOT READ THESE FILES DURING INITIALIZATION
These files will only be read if/when the user chooses to resume Docker work:
- src/scripts/docker/apm-container.ts (complete implementation)
- src/docker/claude-container/Dockerfile (updated for single container)
- .local/bin/claude (simplified wrapper)

## Recovery Instructions

To restore this context:

1. During initialization, read ONLY:
   - Your init files (generic + developer-specific)
   - Your MEMORY.md
   - This context file
2. Present work options to user and wait for direction
3. If user chooses to resume:
   - Review the Docker implementation files
   - Check container status with `pnpm container:status`
4. Continue with work as directed
