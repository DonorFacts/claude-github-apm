Agent Role: developer
Agent Instance: Master Developer

## Current State

### Role & Responsibilities

- **Primary Role**: Master Developer - Elite software engineer responsible for implementing features, fixing bugs, and maintaining code quality
- **Current Focus**: Command sync system implementation with simplified naming convention
- **Key Responsibilities**: Feature implementation, TDD practices, code quality, performance optimization

### Active Work

#### Current Task

- **Task ID**: Command Sync System Implementation
- **Status**: completed
- **Started**: 2025-01-25T15:00:00Z
- **Work Completed**: 
  - Implemented simplified command classifier (underscore-based exclusion)
  - Created flattened naming convention (path-to-hyphens transformation)
  - Fixed all tests to match new behavior
  - Added terminal title updates
  - Created comprehensive documentation
- **Work Remaining**: None - feature complete
- **Related Issues**: None (draft feature)

#### Work in Progress

All implementation complete. No pending code changes.

### Recent Context

#### Recent Git Commits

- 513d30c: feat: implement command sync system with TDD

#### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Simplified classification to underscore-based exclusion
   - **Rationale**: User requested ALL files be included except those with underscore prefix
   - **Impact**: Much simpler logic, more predictable behavior
   - **Time**: 2025-01-25T15:30:00Z
   - **Approved By**: Jake (User)

2. **Decision**: Flattened naming convention with hyphen separation
   - **Rationale**: User wants simple names like `/context-save` and `/git-worktree-create`
   - **Impact**: Easy to type and remember commands
   - **Time**: 2025-01-25T15:32:00Z
   - **Approved By**: Jake (User)

#### Problems Encountered

- **Issue**: Initial implementation filtered too many files based on import analysis
  - **Status**: Resolved
  - **Approach**: Simplified to underscore-only exclusion rule

#### User Communications

- 15:00: User initiated handover for command sync system continuation
- 15:30: User requested simpler classification (underscore-only exclusion)
- 15:35: User discovered "-" folder for enhanced autocomplete UX
- 15:40: User requested context save due to low context (11%)

### Understanding & Insights

#### Project Patterns

- **TDD Workflow**: Write tests → Verify failure → Implement → Verify pass
- **Simplified Design**: User prefers simple, predictable rules over complex analysis
- **UX Enhancement**: "-" folder provides better autocomplete than native .claude/commands

#### Technical Context

- **Architecture**: Simple file watcher → classifier → transformer → sync
- **Constraints**: Must handle empty files, underscore prefixes
- **Dependencies**: chokidar for watching, glob for file discovery
- **GitHub Integration**: Not yet integrated with issues

### Pending Items

#### Immediate Next Steps

1. Update file watcher to also sync to "-" folder for enhanced autocomplete
2. Add configuration option for dual output paths
3. Consider making "-" the primary location if it provides better UX

#### Waiting For

- None

#### Questions/Concerns

- Should the "-" folder become the primary location for commands?
- Should we maintain both locations or migrate to "-" only?

### Git-Based Memory Status

- **Last Commit**: 513d30c feat: implement command sync system with TDD
- **Uncommitted Changes**: Multiple files modified for simplified implementation
- **Next Commit Plans**: Commit the simplified implementation

### Environment State

- **Current Directory**: /Users/jakedetels/www/claude-github-apm/worktrees/feature-command-sync-system
- **Open Files**: Multiple command-sync files
- **Modified Files**: 
  - src/command-sync/command-classifier.ts
  - src/command-sync/command-name-transformer.ts
  - tests/command-sync/*.test.ts
  - docs/command-naming-convention.md
  - docs/commands-guide.md
- **Active Branch**: feature-command-sync-system

### Handover Notes

**Critical Information**: 
- Command sync system is fully functional with simplified rules
- User discovered "-" folder provides better autocomplete UX
- All files included except those with underscore prefix

**Watch Out For**: 
- The "-" folder is a manual copy of .claude/commands
- Need to implement automatic sync to both locations

**Recommended Approach**: 
- Update FileWatcher to support multiple target directories
- Consider making "-" the primary location

**Key Files to Review**:

```
DO NOT READ THESE FILES DURING INITIALIZATION
These files will only be read if/when the user chooses to resume this work:
- src/command-sync/file-watcher.ts (needs update for dual output)
- src/command-sync/index.ts (may need config for multiple targets)
- package.json (scripts are complete)
```

**Work Completed**:
- Simplified CommandClassifier to use underscore-only exclusion
- Updated CommandNameTransformer for simple path flattening
- Fixed all tests to match new behavior
- Created comprehensive documentation

## Recovery Instructions

To restore this context:

1. During initialization, read ONLY:
   - Your init files (generic + role-specific)
   - Your MEMORY.md
   - This context file
2. Present work options to user and wait for direction
3. If user chooses to resume:
   - Read the specific files listed above
   - Run `git status` to check for uncommitted changes
   - Review recent commits if needed
4. Continue with work as directed

## Key Innovation: "-" Folder for Enhanced Autocomplete

User discovered that creating a duplicate command folder named "-" in the repo root provides enhanced UX:
- Native .claude/commands only offers autocomplete when typing "/" at start
- The "-" folder allows autocomplete via "@-/command-name" at any point in the prompt
- This enables mid-sentence command references with full autocomplete support
- Current implementation requires manual copy, needs automation

## Next Steps for "-" Folder Integration

1. Update FileWatcher to accept multiple target paths
2. Modify sync logic to write to both .claude/commands and "-"
3. Consider configuration options for target directories
4. Document the enhanced autocomplete feature in user guide
