Agent Role: developer
Agent Instance: Master Developer

## Current State

### Role & Responsibilities

- **Primary Role**: Full-stack developer specializing in Docker containerization and clipboard integration
- **Current Focus**: Completed clipboard bridge redesign and Docker node_modules platform mismatch fixes
- **Key Responsibilities**: 
  - Fix Docker/container integration issues
  - Implement reliable clipboard functionality
  - Resolve platform-specific dependency conflicts
  - Maintain code quality and testing standards

### Active Work

#### Current Task

- **Task ID**: fix-docker-node-modules
- **Status**: completed
- **Started**: This session
- **Work Completed**: 
  - Redesigned clipboard bridge from complex HTTP service to simple file-based approach
  - Fixed Docker node_modules platform mismatch (esbuild @esbuild/linux-arm64 vs @esbuild/darwin-arm64)
  - Updated Dockerfile to install Linux-specific dependencies in container
  - Created .dockerignore to exclude host node_modules
  - Modified docker-compose.yml to use named volumes for container node_modules
  - Updated watch-all.sh to use file-based clipboard instead of HTTP service
  - Fixed Dockerfile syntax errors (broken cat heredoc commands)
- **Work Remaining**: None - all major issues resolved
- **Related Issues**: esbuild platform conflicts, clipboard service crashes

#### Work in Progress

No active work in progress - session focused on fixing critical Docker and clipboard issues.

## Recent Context

#### Recent Git Commits

No commits made during this session. All changes are uncommitted and ready for commit:

- 9304120: feat: add workspace read permission to settings
- 3a52e37: feat: implement automatic environment loading for containerized Claude
- cb4d76c: feat: add test worktree for developer role workflow validation

#### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Replace HTTP-based clipboard service with file-based approach
   - **Rationale**: HTTP service was causing crashes, platform conflicts, and complexity
   - **Impact**: Eliminated esbuild issues, improved reliability, simplified architecture
   - **Time**: During this session
   - **Approved By**: User (Jake) after HTTP service failures

2. **Decision**: Separate Docker container node_modules from host node_modules
   - **Rationale**: Platform mismatch between macOS host and Linux container causing esbuild errors
   - **Impact**: Container gets Linux binaries, host keeps macOS binaries
   - **Time**: During this session
   - **Approved By**: User after repeated esbuild failures

3. **Decision**: Rewrite Dockerfile with cleaner syntax
   - **Rationale**: Original had broken cat heredoc syntax causing build failures
   - **Impact**: Clean, maintainable Docker build process
   - **Time**: End of session
   - **Approved By**: User due to build failures

#### Problems Encountered

- **Issue**: esbuild platform mismatch (@esbuild/linux-arm64 vs @esbuild/darwin-arm64)
  - **Status**: Resolved
  - **Approach**: Separated host and container node_modules with Docker named volumes
  - **GitHub Issue**: Not tracked

- **Issue**: HTTP clipboard service crashes and complexity
  - **Status**: Resolved
  - **Approach**: Replaced with simple file-based clipboard bridge
  - **GitHub Issue**: Not tracked

- **Issue**: Dockerfile syntax errors (unknown instruction: cat)
  - **Status**: Resolved
  - **Approach**: Rewrote Dockerfile with proper RUN command syntax
  - **GitHub Issue**: Not tracked

#### User Communications

Recent important exchanges:

- User reported clipboard service taking 5+ minutes and crashing Claude process
- User asked for review against established solutions (isomorphic_copy research)
- User requested specific test steps for Docker fixes
- User wanted rebuild-container script added to package.json

### Understanding & Insights

#### Project Patterns

- APM framework uses watch processes started via `pnpm start`
- File-based approaches often more reliable than HTTP services for Docker
- User strongly prefers simple, established solutions over custom complex ones
- Docker node_modules sharing between platforms causes binary conflicts

#### Technical Context

- **Architecture**: Docker containerized development with host/container file sharing
- **Constraints**: macOS host, Linux container, platform-specific node modules
- **Dependencies**: pnpm, tsx, Docker named volumes, file-based IPC
- **Key Files**: docker-compose.yml, Dockerfile, watch-all.sh, file-bridge.ts

### Pending Items

#### Immediate Next Steps

1. Test the rebuilt container with `pnpm rebuild-container`
2. Verify no esbuild errors in `npm start` output
3. Test file-based clipboard functionality
4. Consider committing the clipboard bridge redesign

#### Waiting For

- User testing of rebuild-container script
- User verification that esbuild errors are resolved
- User confirmation that clipboard bridge works reliably

#### Questions/Concerns

- File-based clipboard may need host-side watcher for full bidirectional sync
- Container rebuilds may be needed after any package.json changes

### Git-Based Memory Status

- **Last Commit**: 9304120 (feat: add workspace read permission to settings)
- **Uncommitted Changes**: Extensive changes across clipboard bridge, Docker configs, scripts
- **Next Commit Plans**: Could commit the complete clipboard bridge redesign and Docker fixes

### Environment State

- **Current Directory**: /workspace/main (Docker container)
- **Open Files**: Multiple clipboard bridge and Docker configuration files modified
- **Modified Files**: 
  - src/tools/clipboard-bridge/file-bridge.ts (new file-based implementation)
  - src/docker/claude-container/Dockerfile (rewritten for clean syntax)
  - src/docker/claude-container/docker-compose.yml (named volumes configuration)
  - src/scripts/watch-all.sh (updated for file-based clipboard)
  - .dockerignore (new file excluding host node_modules)
  - rebuild-container.sh (new rebuild script)
  - package.json (added rebuild-container script)
- **Active Branch**: main
- **Container Status**: Currently running in Docker container

### Handover Notes

**Critical Information**: 
- Clipboard bridge completely redesigned from HTTP service to file-based approach
- Docker node_modules platform mismatch resolved with separated volumes
- All major infrastructure issues from this session have been addressed

**Watch Out For**: 
- User needs to test rebuild-container script to verify Docker fixes
- File-based clipboard needs testing for end-to-end functionality
- May need host-side watcher for full clipboard sync

**Recommended Approach**: 
- All technical issues resolved, ready for user testing
- Implementation is much simpler and more reliable than previous HTTP approach
- Focus should be on validation rather than further development

**Key Files to Review**:

DO NOT READ THESE FILES DURING INITIALIZATION
These files will only be read if/when the user chooses to resume this work:
- src/tools/clipboard-bridge/file-bridge.ts (complete file-based implementation)
- src/docker/claude-container/Dockerfile (rewritten clean version)
- src/docker/claude-container/docker-compose.yml (named volumes configuration)
- src/scripts/watch-all.sh (updated for file-based clipboard)
- rebuild-container.sh (new rebuild script)
- .dockerignore (node_modules exclusion)

**Open PRs/Issues**: None

**Modified Files**: See Environment State section above

**Work in Progress**: None - major redesign complete, ready for testing

## Recovery Instructions

To restore this context:

1. During initialization, read ONLY:
   - Your init files (generic + role-specific)
   - Your MEMORY.md
   - This context file
2. Present work options to user and wait for direction
3. If user chooses to resume:
   - Read the specific files listed above
   - Run `git status` to check for uncommitted changes
   - Help user test the rebuild-container script
4. Continue with work as directed
