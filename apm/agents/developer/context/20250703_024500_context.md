- **Key Responsibilities**: Feature implementation, bug resolution, session management architecture, TDD compliance

### Active Work

#### Current Task

- **Task ID**: Claude Code SDK integration for session management
- **Status**: design_phase
- **Started**: 2025-07-03T02:00:00Z
- **Work Completed**: 
  - ✅ **Analyzed CLI vs SDK approaches** for session management
  - ✅ **Identified UX concerns** with pure SDK approach
  - ✅ **Designed hybrid solution** combining SDK + CLI handoff
  - ✅ **Created SDK integration files** (init-sdk.ts, restore-sdk.ts, sdk-session-manager.ts)
  - ✅ **Researched Claude Code SDK** capabilities and limitations
- **Work Remaining**: 
  - Install @anthropic-ai/claude-code SDK package
  - Implement hybrid SDK+CLI session flow
  - Test session ID capture and restoration
  - Update CLI commands to use hybrid approach
- **Related Issues**: Session restoration system overhaul

#### Work in Progress

```typescript
// Hybrid approach design - SDK for session management, CLI for UX
async function initializeAgentWithHybridApproach(options) {
  // 1. Use SDK to start conversation and capture session ID
  const sessionId = await startConversationWithSDK(agentPrompt);
  
  // 2. Create bridge mapping for restoration
  bridge.createBridgeMapping(apmSessionId, sessionId, projectPath);
  
  // 3. Hand off to CLI for full interactive experience
  spawn('claude', ['--resume', sessionId], { stdio: 'inherit' });
}
```

### Recent Context

#### Recent Git Commits

No commits made yet - working on design phase:
- Session restoration system using Claude Code SDK
- UX analysis for interactive experience preservation
- Hybrid SDK+CLI architecture design

#### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Use hybrid SDK+CLI approach instead of pure SDK
   - **Rationale**: SDK excellent for session management but CLI superior for interactive UX
   - **Impact**: Get benefits of both - programmatic control + natural terminal experience
   - **Time**: 2025-07-03T02:45:00Z
   - **Approved By**: Jake (implicit through UX quality requirement)

2. **Decision**: Abandon pure CLI spawn approach in favor of SDK integration
   - **Rationale**: CLI spawning had session ID capture limitations and complex file scanning
   - **Impact**: Cleaner integration, direct session ID access, better error handling
   - **Time**: 2025-07-03T02:30:00Z
   - **Approved By**: Jake

3. **Decision**: Remove redundant recover command, consolidate to restore
   - **Rationale**: User feedback that recover/restore mean the same thing
   - **Impact**: Simplified CLI interface, single restoration pathway
   - **Time**: 2025-07-03T02:15:00Z
   - **Approved By**: Jake

#### Problems Encountered

- **Issue**: Pure SDK approach may compromise interactive UX quality
  - **Status**: ✅ **Resolved**
  - **Approach**: Designed hybrid SDK+CLI solution
  - **Solution**: Use SDK for session management, CLI handoff for interactive experience

- **Issue**: Package installation conflicts with pnpm store locations
  - **Status**: **Pending**
  - **Approach**: May need to resolve pnpm store issue or work around dependency installation
  - **Impact**: Blocking SDK testing until resolved

#### User Communications

- **02:30**: Jake suggested using Claude Code SDK instead of CLI spawning for better session management
- **02:40**: Jake emphasized importance of preserving interactive UX quality equal to baseline Claude Code CLI
- **02:42**: Jake requested context save before proceeding with implementation

### Understanding & Insights

#### Project Patterns

- Jake values both technical excellence AND user experience quality
- Solutions must be operationally superior while maintaining or improving UX
- Hybrid approaches often better than pure solutions when balancing competing needs
- Session management is critical infrastructure that must be reliable and transparent

#### Technical Context

- **Architecture**: Hybrid SDK+CLI approach for session management
- **Key Innovation**: Use SDK for programmatic control, CLI for interactive UX
- **Session Flow**: SDK initialization → Bridge mapping → CLI handoff → Interactive experience
- **Dependencies**: @anthropic-ai/claude-code SDK, existing CLI functionality, bridge mapping system
- **UX Requirement**: Must equal or exceed baseline Claude Code CLI interactive experience

#### SDK vs CLI Analysis

**Claude Code CLI Strengths**:
- Natural terminal interactive experience
- Real-time stdin/stdout conversation flow
- Built-in terminal integration and controls
- Proven session persistence and UX

**Claude Code SDK Strengths**:
- Direct session ID access (no file scanning)
- Programmatic error handling
- TypeScript native integration
- Better automation capabilities

**Hybrid Solution Benefits**:
- ✅ Session ID capture from SDK
- ✅ Full interactive UX from CLI
- ✅ Programmatic control + natural experience
- ✅ Best of both architectures

### Pending Items

#### Immediate Next Steps

1. Resolve pnpm dependency installation issue
2. Install @anthropic-ai/claude-code SDK package
3. Implement hybrid SDK+CLI session initialization flow
4. Test session ID capture and bridge mapping creation
5. Implement hybrid restoration flow
6. Update CLI commands to use hybrid approach

#### Questions/Concerns

- **Package installation**: Need to resolve pnpm store location conflicts
- **SDK interactive capabilities**: Verify SDK can't provide equivalent interactive UX (confirming hybrid approach)
- **Error handling**: Ensure graceful fallbacks if SDK fails but CLI works

### Git-Based Memory Status

  - Added: src/cli/user/init-sdk.ts (hybrid initialization design)
  - Added: src/cli/user/restore-sdk.ts (hybrid restoration design)  
  - Added: src/sessions/sdk-session-manager.ts (SDK abstraction layer)
  - Added: src/sessions/uuid-capture.ts (session ID capture utilities)
  - Modified: src/sessions/claude-code-bridge.ts (enhanced UUID scanning)
  - Modified: src/cli/user/restore.ts (working CLI-based restoration)
  - Removed: CLI references to recover command (consolidated to restore)
- **Next Commit Plans**: Commit SDK integration architecture and hybrid approach design

### Environment State

- **Current Directory**: /workspace/worktrees/feature-multi-agent-memory-architecture
- **Active Branch**: feature-multi-agent-memory-architecture
- **Session Management**: Revolutionary file-per-session architecture with SDK integration planned

### Handover Notes

**Critical Information**: 
- Session restoration system redesigned around Claude Code SDK for better session management
- Hybrid approach preserves interactive UX while gaining programmatic benefits
- Working CLI-based restoration already functional as fallback
- SDK integration blocked on package installation - may need pnpm store resolution

**UX Quality Requirement**:
- Must maintain or exceed baseline Claude Code CLI interactive experience
- SDK used for session management, CLI for actual interactive conversation
- No compromise on user experience for technical benefits

**Key Architectural Decision**:
- **Hybrid SDK+CLI approach** chosen over pure SDK or pure CLI
- SDK handles: session initialization, ID capture, bridge mapping
- CLI handles: interactive conversation, natural terminal UX

**Key Files Modified**:

DO NOT READ THESE FILES DURING INITIALIZATION
These files will only be read if/when the user chooses to resume this work:
- src/cli/user/init-sdk.ts (lines 1-200: hybrid initialization implementation)
- src/cli/user/restore-sdk.ts (lines 1-250: hybrid restoration implementation)
- src/sessions/sdk-session-manager.ts (lines 1-300: SDK abstraction layer)
- src/sessions/uuid-capture.ts (lines 1-150: session ID capture utilities)
- src/sessions/claude-code-bridge.ts (enhanced with scanning capabilities)

**Implementation Status**:
- ✅ Architecture designed and files created
- ✅ UX analysis completed with hybrid solution
- ⏳ SDK package installation needed
- ⏳ Hybrid flow implementation and testing
- ✅ Fallback CLI restoration working

## Recovery Instructions

To restore this context:

1. During initialization, read ONLY:
   - Your init files (generic + role-specific)
   - Your MEMORY.md
   - This context file
2. Present work options to user and wait for direction
3. If user chooses to resume: 
   - Note that SDK package installation may be needed first
   - Review hybrid approach design in SDK files
   - Test existing CLI restoration functionality
   - Proceed with hybrid implementation
4. Architecture decision is solid - focus on implementation and testing
