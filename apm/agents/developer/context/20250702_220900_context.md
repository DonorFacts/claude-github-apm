### Recent Context

#### Recent Git Commits

No commits made yet - all changes are ready for a comprehensive commit:
- Enhanced session management CLI with activity tracking
- Eliminated paused state from system
- Added rich display with colored time indicators
- Migrated to clean CLI structure

#### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Eliminate paused state from session management
   - **Rationale**: User feedback that paused state was unnecessary complexity
   - **Impact**: Simplified state machine to active/completed/stale only
   - **Time**: 2025-07-02T21:20:00Z
   - **Approved By**: Jake

2. **Decision**: Put agent and user activity on same line with "Last seen:" prefix
   - **Rationale**: User requested improved formatting for better readability
   - **Impact**: Cleaner, more compact display
   - **Time**: 2025-07-02T21:30:00Z
   - **Approved By**: Jake

3. **Decision**: Move speak command from package.json to CLI structure
   - **Rationale**: User wanted clean package.json without script pollution
   - **Impact**: Standardized agent commands via `pnpm cli <command>`
   - **Time**: 2025-07-02T22:00:00Z
   - **Approved By**: Jake

#### Problems Encountered

- **Issue**: Manual CLI commands would never be called automatically
  - **Status**: ‚úÖ **Resolved**
  - **Approach**: Integrated activity tracking into required `pnpm cli speak` command and created easy-to-use CLI structure
  - **Solution**: Automated tracking through existing required workflow commands

#### User Communications

- **21:20**: Jake identified that paused state should be eliminated entirely
- **21:25**: Jake requested agent and user info on same line with "Last seen:" prefix  
- **21:45**: Jake pointed out manual CLI commands wouldn't be called automatically
- **22:00**: Jake requested moving speak command to CLI structure instead of package.json pollution

### Understanding & Insights

#### Project Patterns

- Jake values architectural simplicity over complex monitoring solutions
- Manual user control preferred over automatic state transitions
- Clean package.json structure important - avoid script pollution
- CLI standardization preferred: `pnpm cli <command>` pattern
- Integration must be automatic through required workflows, not manual commands

#### Technical Context

- **Architecture**: File-per-session with directory-based status organization (active/completed/stale)
- **Key Innovation**: Status determined by file location, not artificial processes
- **CLI Structure**: Unified commands under `src/cli/agent/` and `src/cli/user/`
- **Activity Tracking**: Automatic integration via required `pnpm cli speak` calls
- **Dependencies**: SessionFileManager class, enhanced CLI commands, comprehensive interface updates

### Pending Items

#### Immediate Next Steps

1. Commit all session management enhancements with comprehensive commit message
2. Update documentation if needed
3. Consider any additional testing

#### Questions/Concerns

None - implementation is complete and working perfectly.

- ‚úÖ Enhanced display with colored time indicators and rich session details  
- ‚úÖ Automated activity tracking through existing required workflows
- ‚úÖ Clean CLI architecture: `pnpm cli <command>` pattern
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive session interface with agent/user activity fields

**Key Files Modified**:

DO NOT READ THESE FILES DURING INITIALIZATION
These files will only be read if/when the user chooses to resume this work:
