# Agent Context Snapshot

Generated: 2025-06-29T19:51:00Z
Agent Role: developer
Agent Instance: APM Master Developer

## Current State

### Role & Responsibilities

- **Primary Role**: APM Master Developer - implementing features, fixing bugs, maintaining code quality
- **Current Focus**: GitHub bot account integration for secure worktree operations
- **Key Responsibilities**: Feature implementation, bug resolution, code quality, performance optimization, security implementation, documentation

### Active Work

#### Current Task

- **Task ID**: GitHub bot account integration and worktree security setup
- **Status**: completed
- **Started**: 2025-06-29T19:00:00Z
- **Work Completed**: 
  - Updated worktree creation guide for container integration
  - Implemented GitHub bot account fallback system in container scripts
  - Added bot git credential configuration to create-handover.sh script
  - Updated README with bot account setup instructions (recommended vs required)
  - Added warning messages when bot token not available
- **Work Remaining**: None for this task
- **Related Issues**: None (feature branch work)

#### Work in Progress

All requested work completed. System now supports:
- Bot account for GitHub operations with fallback to personal credentials
- Clear warnings when using personal account
- Automatic git config setup in worktrees
- Container integration with proper token handling

### Recent Context

#### Recent Git Commits

- 5927bd9: fix: resolve container notification issues and clean up dead security code
- 7bb15b9: memory: save developer context and insights from Docker implementation
- 4d29ef6: feat: implement single-container Docker architecture

#### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Use fallback to personal GitHub token when bot token missing
   - **Rationale**: Better UX - works immediately while encouraging bot setup
   - **Impact**: Bot account becomes recommended rather than required
   - **Time**: 2025-06-29T19:45:00Z
   - **Approved By**: Jake (user request)

2. **Decision**: Add warning messages during worktree creation when using personal account
   - **Rationale**: Security awareness - users should know when commits come from personal account
   - **Impact**: Clear visibility into which credentials are being used
   - **Time**: 2025-06-29T19:45:00Z
   - **Approved By**: Jake (user request)

3. **Decision**: Update git config in create-handover.sh script instead of create.md prompt
   - **Rationale**: Keep prompts concise, handle configuration in scripts
   - **Impact**: Better separation of concerns, less token usage in prompts
   - **Time**: 2025-06-29T19:30:00Z
   - **Approved By**: Jake (user preference for script-based approach)

#### Problems Encountered

- **Issue**: Initial approach put bot setup instructions in verbose prompt file
  - **Status**: Resolved
  - **Approach**: Moved to script-based configuration with concise prompts
  - **GitHub Issue**: None

#### User Communications

- 2025-06-29T19:00:00Z: User asked to validate worktree creation for container integration
- 2025-06-29T19:15:00Z: User requested GitHub issue number integration verification
- 2025-06-29T19:25:00Z: User asked about bot account GitHub integration
- 2025-06-29T19:30:00Z: User preferred script-based config over prompt verbosity
- 2025-06-29T19:40:00Z: User requested fallback to personal token with warnings

### Understanding & Insights

#### Project Patterns

- User prefers concise prompts over verbose instructions
- Script-based configuration preferred over prompt-embedded setup
- Security through warnings and education rather than hard requirements
- Fallback systems improve user experience while maintaining security awareness

#### Technical Context

- **Architecture**: Single-container Docker with git worktree support
- **Constraints**: Container scripts must handle token fallback gracefully
- **Dependencies**: GITHUB_BOT_TOKEN (recommended), GITHUB_TOKEN (fallback)
- **Security Model**: Bot account isolation with branch rulesets, fallback to personal with warnings

### Pending Items

#### Immediate Next Steps

1. User requested context save (completed)
2. All GitHub bot integration work completed
3. Ready for new tasks or session end

#### Waiting For

None

#### Questions/Concerns

None

DO NOT READ THESE FILES DURING INITIALIZATION
These files were modified but are in a complete, working state:
- src/scripts/git-worktree/create-handover.sh (bot config logic added)
- .local/bin/claude-container (token fallback implemented)
- .local/bin/claude-shell (token fallback implemented)
- README.md (bot account section updated)

## Recovery Instructions

To restore this context:

1. During initialization, read ONLY:
   - Your init files (generic + developer-specific)
   - Your MEMORY.md
   - This context file
2. Present work options to user and wait for direction
3. If user chooses to resume:
   - Check git status for uncommitted changes
   - Test bot account integration if needed
4. Continue with work as directed
