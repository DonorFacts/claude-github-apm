Agent Role: developer
Agent Instance: Master Developer - Docker Audio/Speech Implementation

## Current State

### Role & Responsibilities

- **Primary Role**: Master Developer implementing Docker containerization features
- **Current Focus**: Completed Docker audio/speech notifications and git worktree fixes
- **Key Responsibilities**: Feature implementation, bug resolution, code quality, documentation

### Active Work

#### Current Task

- **Task ID**: Docker container audio/speech integration
- **Status**: completed
- **Started**: 2025-06-28
- **Work Completed**: 
  - ✅ Implemented Notify_Jake with Hero.aiff sound playback
  - ✅ Created say-from-container.sh for text-to-speech
  - ✅ Built host-side daemons for audio/speech processing
  - ✅ Fixed Docker zshrc mounting issues
  - ✅ Created container-git wrapper for safe git operations
  - ✅ Updated Docker volumes to use host paths (future fix)
  - ✅ Cleaned up 1,542 lines of failed attempts
  - ✅ Documented everything in README, CLAUDE.md, and agent init
- **Work Remaining**: None - feature complete
- **Related Issues**: #docker-audio #container-ux #developer-experience

### Recent Context

#### Recent Git Commits

- 9aeec5b: chore: remove failed attempts and unrelated files
- cf80f8b: chore: add runtime files to gitignore and container-git wrapper
- bfb9aa2: fix: mount Docker volumes at host paths for git compatibility
- 37f43ca: fix: improve git worktree handling in Docker entrypoint
- 344d5c5: feat: implement container audio/speech notifications with host integration

#### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Use file-based queues for audio/speech instead of network
   - **Rationale**: Simpler, more secure, aligns with volume-based architecture
   - **Impact**: Easy to implement, no authentication needed
   - **Time**: 2025-06-28 16:20
   - **Approved By**: Jake

2. **Decision**: Mount directories at host paths to fix git worktree issues
   - **Rationale**: Standard Docker best practice for git worktrees
   - **Impact**: Git commits will be visible on both host and container
   - **Time**: 2025-06-29 00:40
   - **Approved By**: Jake (pending container rebuild)

3. **Decision**: Create container-git wrapper as temporary solution
   - **Rationale**: Allows git operations without breaking VS Code
   - **Impact**: Safe git commits until container rebuild
   - **Time**: 2025-06-29 00:45
   - **Approved By**: Jake

#### Problems Encountered

- **Issue**: Git worktree paths incompatible between host/container
  - **Status**: Resolved with wrapper, permanent fix in next rebuild
  - **Approach**: Mount at host paths instead of /workspace
  - **GitHub Issue**: Not tracked

- **Issue**: Weird directories with ANSI escape codes in filenames
  - **Status**: Resolved - all removed
  - **Approach**: Cleaned up failed devcontainer attempts
  - **GitHub Issue**: Not tracked

#### User Communications

- 16:05: Jake requested handover for sound/Docker permissions
- 16:32: Jake confirmed Hero.aiff sound working
- 00:20: Jake concerned about git worktree pointing to main
- 00:45: Jake requested cleanup of failed attempts

### Understanding & Insights

#### Project Patterns

- Jake's Notify_Jake uses `afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Hero.aiff`
- Authentication via ~/.claude.json (not .credentials.json)
- Git worktrees need consistent paths between host/container
- Simple file-based IPC preferred over complex networking

#### Technical Context

- **Architecture**: Docker containers with transparent wrappers
- **Constraints**: Can't access host audio directly from container
- **Dependencies**: fswatch/polling for file monitoring
- **Audio Solution**: Queue files processed by host daemons

### Pending Items

#### Immediate Next Steps

1. User needs to rebuild container for path mount fixes
2. Consider adding voice selection for say command
3. Monitor performance of polling daemons

#### Questions/Concerns

- Will polling daemons impact battery on MacBooks?
- Should we add systemd/launchd integration?

### Environment State

- **Current Directory**: /workspace
- **Active Branch**: test-docker-setup
- **Modified Files**: None (all committed)
- **Container Image**: Needs rebuild for mount fixes

### Handover Notes

**Critical Information**: 
- Docker audio/speech fully working with host daemons
- Git worktree issue has temporary fix (container-git wrapper)
- Permanent git fix requires container rebuild

**Watch Out For**: 
- Don't modify .git file directly - breaks VS Code
- Host daemons must be running for audio/speech
- Container uses /workspace, host uses actual paths

**Recommended Approach**:
1. Rebuild container to test new mount strategy
2. Verify git commits visible on both host/container
3. Consider daemon auto-start integration

**Key Files to Review**:
```
DO NOT READ THESE FILES DURING INITIALIZATION
These files will only be read if/when the user chooses to resume this work:
- src/docker/claude-container/Dockerfile (mount strategy changes)
- src/docker/claude-container/claude-wrapper.sh (path mounting logic)
- .local/bin/container-git (temporary git wrapper)
- .local/bin/host-sound-daemon.sh (audio queue processor)
- .local/bin/host-speech-daemon.sh (speech queue processor)
```

## Recovery Instructions

To restore this context:
1. Read only init files, MEMORY.md, and this context during init
2. Present Docker audio/speech work as complete
3. If user wants to continue, read the specific files listed
4. Check daemon status and container rebuild needs
