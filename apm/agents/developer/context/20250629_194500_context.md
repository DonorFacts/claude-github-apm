# Agent Context Snapshot

Generated: 2025-06-29T19:45:00Z
Agent Role: developer
Agent Instance: APM Master Developer Agent

## Current State

### Role & Responsibilities

- **Primary Role**: APM Master Developer Agent - Framework development and maintenance
- **Current Focus**: Documentation completion and conversation continuity from previous session
- **Key Responsibilities**: 
  - Initialize and manage APM framework development
  - Complete GitHub bot account integration
  - Maintain development tool organization patterns
  - Document framework conventions and best practices

### Active Work

#### Current Task

- **Task ID**: Documentation completion from previous conversation
- **Status**: completed
- **Started**: Previous session (continued from context limit)
- **Work Completed**: 
  - Verified comprehensive `docs/debugging-tools.md` (390 lines)
  - Confirmed concise README.md section with reference to detailed guide
  - Validated package.json script organization with comment patterns
  - Confirmed GitHub bot account integration is complete
- **Work Remaining**: None from current session
- **Related Issues**: Documentation work referenced in conversation summary

#### Work in Progress

No active code development in this session - was continuation/verification work.

### Recent Context

#### Recent Git Commits

From conversation summary, recent commits include:
- GitHub bot account integration with fallback system
- File cleanup (removed 5 unused files from .local/bin/)
- Package.json organization with script grouping
- Documentation creation (debugging-tools.md, github-bot-account.md)

#### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Use `.dev.ext` naming convention for development tools
   - **Rationale**: Clear separation from production code, co-location benefits
   - **Impact**: Established framework-wide pattern for debugging tools
   - **Time**: Previous session
   - **Approved By**: User (Jake)

2. **Decision**: GitHub bot account as "recommended" not "required"
   - **Rationale**: Graceful fallback to personal credentials prevents blocking
   - **Impact**: More flexible deployment, better developer experience
   - **Time**: Previous session
   - **Approved By**: User (Jake)

#### Problems Encountered

- **Issue**: Previous session reached context limits during documentation work
  - **Status**: Resolved
  - **Approach**: Continuation session with context summary
  - **GitHub Issue**: N/A

#### User Communications

Recent important exchanges:
- Session started with continuation from previous conversation
- User provided comprehensive conversation summary for context
- Work was verification/completion rather than new development
- No new requests or changes needed

### Understanding & Insights

#### Project Patterns

- **Documentation Organization**: Summary in README.md + detailed guides in docs/
- **Development Tools**: `.dev.ext` convention with comprehensive header documentation
- **Security Model**: GitHub bot account with graceful fallback to personal credentials
- **Container Architecture**: Single persistent container for all agents and worktrees

#### Technical Context

- **Architecture**: APM framework with multi-agent coordination
- **Constraints**: Context limits require conversation continuity protocols
- **Dependencies**: Docker, GitHub CLI, pnpm, TypeScript
- **GitHub Integration**: Bot account integration, issue tracking, branch rulesets

### Pending Items

#### Immediate Next Steps

1. No immediate tasks pending from current session
2. Framework is in good state with documentation complete
3. Ready for new feature development or maintenance tasks

#### Waiting For

- No pending dependencies
- Framework ready for new user requests

#### Questions/Concerns

- None from current session
- Documentation work appears complete and comprehensive

### Git-Based Memory Status

- **Last Commit**: Documentation commits from previous session (debugging-tools.md, README updates)
- **Uncommitted Changes**: None observed (docs/github-security.md is untracked but not part of current work)
- **Next Commit Plans**: None pending for current work

### Environment State

- **Current Directory**: /Users/jakedetels/www/claude-github-apm/worktrees/feature-draft-git-worktree-docs
- **Open Files**: Verified documentation files during session
- **Modified Files**: None from current session
- **Active Branch**: feature-draft-git-worktree-docs

### Handover Notes

**Critical Information**: 
- Framework documentation is complete and comprehensive
- GitHub bot account integration is functional with fallback
- Development tool organization patterns are established
- Container architecture is stable and documented

**Watch Out For**: 
- Context limits when working on large documentation projects
- Need to maintain conversation continuity protocols

**Recommended Approach**: 
- Framework is ready for new feature development
- Documentation patterns are established for future work
- Follow TDD practices per CLAUDE.md requirements

**Key Files to Review**: 

DO NOT READ THESE FILES DURING INITIALIZATION
These files are complete and verified, read only if user requests changes:
- docs/debugging-tools.md (comprehensive development tool guide)
- docs/github-bot-account.md (bot account setup guide) 
- README.md (updated with tool organization summary)
- package.json (organized script structure with comments)

**Work in Progress**: No incomplete work from this session

## Recovery Instructions

To restore this context:

1. During initialization, read ONLY:
   - APM Master Developer Agent init files
   - MEMORY.md for this role
   - This context file
2. Present work options to user and wait for direction
3. Framework is in good state - ready for new tasks
4. If user wants to review documentation, read the files listed above
5. Continue with new work as directed

## Context Save Purpose

This save represents completion of documentation work from previous session that hit context limits. Framework is in good state with comprehensive documentation and established patterns.
