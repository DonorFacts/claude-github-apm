# Agent Context Snapshot

Generated: 2025-06-29T16:39:41Z
Agent Role: developer
Agent Instance: APM Master Developer Agent

## Current State

### Role & Responsibilities

- **Primary Role**: APM Master Developer Agent - Framework development and maintenance
- **Current Focus**: Worktree workflow improvements and container integration
- **Key Responsibilities**: 
  - Implement and fix worktree creation and handover systems
  - Maintain development tool organization patterns
  - Ensure consistent container-based workflows
  - Debug and resolve path handling issues

### Active Work

#### Current Task

- **Task ID**: Worktree workflow container requirement implementation
- **Status**: completed
- **Started**: Earlier in session
- **Work Completed**: 
  - Fixed worktree handover system for container environments
  - Updated handover file location to agent-specific directories
  - Implemented container requirement validation
  - Simplified path handling by requiring container mode
  - Created multiple test worktrees to validate fixes
- **Work Remaining**: None from current session
- **Related Issues**: GitHub issues #395, #396

#### Work in Progress

No active code development in this session - was system improvement and testing work.

### Recent Context

#### Recent Git Commits

Recent commits relevant to current work:
- c9dab16: feat: require container environment for worktree workflows
- e1e7b43: refactor: update worktree handover system to use agent-specific directories

#### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Require container environment for all worktree workflows
   - **Rationale**: Eliminates host/container path translation complexity
   - **Impact**: Simplifies all handover scripts and ensures predictable behavior
   - **Time**: Current session
   - **Approved By**: User (Jake)

2. **Decision**: Move handover files to agent-specific directories
   - **Rationale**: Better organization and single source of truth
   - **Impact**: Handover files now only in `apm/agents/<role>/not-started/`
   - **Time**: Current session
   - **Approved By**: User (Jake)

3. **Decision**: Remove dual handover file creation
   - **Rationale**: User requested single location instead of main + worktree
   - **Impact**: Cleaner system, less duplication
   - **Time**: Current session
   - **Approved By**: User (Jake)

#### Problems Encountered

- **Issue**: Original handover system had path detection issues in containers
  - **Status**: Resolved
  - **Approach**: Required container mode and simplified path logic
  - **GitHub Issue**: Issues #395, #396 for testing

#### User Communications

Recent important exchanges:
- User identified path mismatch between container and host environments
- User suggested requiring container mode from start to simplify architecture
- User requested handover files only in worktree directories, not duplicated
- User confirmed the simplified approach worked correctly

### Understanding & Insights

#### Project Patterns

- **Container-first architecture**: Requiring container mode eliminates architectural complexity
- **Agent-specific directories**: Using `apm/agents/<role>/` improves organization
- **Single source of truth**: Handover files should exist in one location only
- **Test-driven validation**: Created multiple test worktrees to validate fixes

#### Technical Context

- **Architecture**: APM framework with multi-agent coordination via handover files
- **Constraints**: Claude Code cannot cd outside main directory, container paths differ from host
- **Dependencies**: Docker, VS Code integration, git worktree functionality
- **GitHub Integration**: Issue tracking for worktree testing

### Pending Items

#### Immediate Next Steps

1. No immediate development tasks pending
2. Worktree system is now stable and container-validated
3. Ready for new feature development or maintenance tasks

#### Waiting For

- No pending dependencies
- System ready for production use

#### Questions/Concerns

- None from current session
- Worktree workflow appears robust with container requirement

### Git-Based Memory Status

- **Last Commit**: c9dab16 feat: require container environment for worktree workflows
- **Uncommitted Changes**: None (all changes committed)
- **Next Commit Plans**: None pending for current work

### Environment State

- **Current Directory**: /Users/jakedetels/www/claude-github-apm/main
- **Open Files**: None requiring attention
- **Modified Files**: None uncommitted
- **Active Branch**: main

### Handover Notes

**Critical Information**: 
- Worktree workflow now requires container environment from start
- Handover files moved to agent-specific directories only
- Path handling simplified by container requirement
- Multiple test worktrees created and validated

**Watch Out For**: 
- Users attempting worktree workflows from host environment (will fail with clear error)
- Need to start Claude Code in container mode for worktree functionality

**Recommended Approach**: 
- Continue using container-required workflow for all worktree operations
- Follow updated create.md for consistent worktree creation
- Agent-specific handover directories are now the standard

**Key Files Modified**: 
- src/prompts/git/worktrees/create.md (updated with container requirements)
- src/scripts/git-worktree/create-handover.sh (simplified for container-only)
- src/scripts/git-worktree/check-handover.sh (container validation and agent paths)

**Test Worktrees Created**:
- feature-395-test-worktree-creation
- feature-396-test-worktree-validation  
- test-worktree-final-validation

**Work Completed**: Worktree system improvements are complete and tested

## Recovery Instructions

To restore this context:

1. During initialization, read ONLY:
   - APM Master Developer Agent init files
   - MEMORY.md for developer role
   - This context file
2. Present work options to user and wait for direction
3. Framework is in excellent state - ready for new feature development
4. If user wants to review worktree changes, they're all committed in git history
5. Continue with new work as directed

## Context Save Purpose

This save represents completion of major worktree workflow improvements. The system now requires container environment for predictable operation and uses agent-specific directories for better organization. Framework is stable and ready for production use.
