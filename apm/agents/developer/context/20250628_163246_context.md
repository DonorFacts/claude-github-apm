# Agent Context Snapshot

Generated: 2025-06-28T16:05:00Z
Agent Role: developer
Agent Instance: Docker Container Development

## Current State

### Role & Responsibilities

- **Primary Role**: Docker containerization specialist
- **Current Focus**: Docker container setup with persistent authentication and sound notifications
- **Key Responsibilities**: Container configuration, shell customization, sound system integration

### Active Work

#### Current Task

- **Task ID**: Docker container setup with Notify_Jake sound functionality
- **Status**: partially_completed
- **Started**: 2025-06-28
- **Work Completed**: 
  - ✅ Docker container built with Claude Code
  - ✅ Authentication persistence via ~/.claude.json mount
  - ✅ Shell customization (bashrc with aliases, history, prompt)
  - ✅ Package.json script for container shell access (`pnpm shell`)
  - ✅ Environment variable passthrough (GITHUB_TOKEN)
  - ✅ direnv installation and hook setup
- **Work Remaining**: 
  - ❌ **CRITICAL**: Fix Notify_Jake sound playback in containers
  - ❌ Docker audio/sound permissions and device access
  - ❌ Test actual sound output (not just visual notification)
- **Related Issues**: Container sound system, Docker device access permissions

#### Work in Progress

**Issue**: The Notify_Jake command in containers produces visual notification but no actual sound:
- Current implementation: `echo -e "\a" && echo "🔔 Task completed by Claude Code!"`
- Problem: Terminal bell (\a) doesn't produce audible sound in Docker containers
- Need: Proper audio device access and sound file playback

**Key Files Modified**:
```
DO NOT READ THESE FILES DURING INITIALIZATION
These files will only be read if/when the user chooses to resume this work:
- src/docker/claude-container/Dockerfile (lines 4-50: added zsh, sox, alsa-utils, shell config)
- src/docker/claude-container/claude-wrapper.sh (lines 126-135, 196: config mounting, env vars)
- .local/bin/claude-shell (lines 141-145: env var passthrough)
- .local/bin/claude (updated wrapper script)
- .envrc (environment configuration)
- package.json (lines 31-32: added shell scripts)
```

### Recent Context

#### Recent Git Commits

- M README.md (modified, not committed)
- M docs/docker-usage.md (modified, not committed)  
- M src/docker/claude-container/Dockerfile (modified, not committed)
- M src/docker/claude-container/claude-wrapper.sh (modified, not committed)
- ?? src/docker/claude-container/init-firewall.sh (new file, not committed)

#### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Mount ~/.claude.json instead of ~/.claude/.credentials.json for authentication
   - **Rationale**: GitHub issue #161 confirmed .claude.json is the correct config file
   - **Impact**: Authentication now persists across container restarts
   - **Time**: 2025-06-28 15:30
   - **Approved By**: Jake (after discovering my initial assumption was wrong)

2. **Decision**: Mirror Jake's ~/.zshrc customizations in container bashrc
   - **Rationale**: Provide familiar shell environment with same aliases and configuration
   - **Impact**: Container feels more like native environment
   - **Time**: 2025-06-28 15:45
   - **Approved By**: Jake

#### Problems Encountered

- **Issue**: Notify_Jake command doesn't produce actual sound in containers
  - **Status**: Pending resolution
  - **Approach**: Need Docker audio device access and proper sound playback mechanism
  - **Root Cause**: Terminal bell (\a) insufficient, need actual audio file playback
  - **Jake's Feedback**: "No, your solution doesn't actually result in a sound playing"

#### User Communications

Recent important exchanges:
- 15:50: Jake confirmed Docker authentication works correctly
- 15:55: Jake requested package.json script for container terminal access
- 16:00: Jake pointed out sound notification doesn't actually play audio
- 16:05: Jake requested handover for sound/Docker permissions issue

### Understanding & Insights

#### Project Patterns

- Authentication via ~/.claude.json file (16MB containing session data)
- Environment-based configuration with .envrc files
- Package.json scripts for workflow automation
- Container-first development approach with transparent wrappers

#### Technical Context

- **Architecture**: Docker containers with volume mounts for isolation + persistence
- **Constraints**: Docker sound/audio requires host device access
- **Dependencies**: macOS sound system (afplay) vs Linux container audio
- **Authentication**: Claude Code uses ~/.claude.json for session persistence

### Pending Items

#### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Research Docker audio solutions**:
   - Docker run with --device /dev/snd for audio access
   - Host audio system integration (macOS -> Linux container)
   - Alternative notification mechanisms (macOS notifications from container)

2. **Fix Notify_Jake sound playback**:
   - Enable Docker audio device access
   - Install/configure audio system in container
   - Test actual sound file playback (not just terminal bell)

3. **Test complete workflow**:
   - Verify sound plays when Claude Code calls Notify_Jake
   - Confirm all shell customizations work properly
   - Document final setup instructions

#### Questions/Concerns

- How to bridge macOS host audio with Linux container audio system?
- Should we use Docker device mounting or alternative approach (like triggering host-side notifications)?
- Container audio permissions and security implications?

### Environment State

- **Current Directory**: /Users/jakedetels/www/claude-github-apm/worktrees/feature-draft-git-worktree-docs
- **Active Branch**: test-script-fixes
- **Container Image**: apm-claude-container:latest (rebuilt with shell customizations)
- **Modified Files**: Multiple Docker and wrapper script files (see work in progress section)

### Handover Notes

**Critical Information**: 
- Docker container authentication is working correctly via ~/.claude.json mount
- Shell customization is complete but Notify_Jake sound is NOT working
- Need to solve Docker audio/sound device access for actual sound playbook

**Watch Out For**: 
- Don't assume terminal bell (\a) produces audible sound in containers
- macOS afplay command doesn't exist in Linux containers
- Docker audio requires specific device access permissions

**Recommended Approach**:
1. Research Docker audio solutions (--device /dev/snd, pulse audio, etc.)
2. Consider alternative: trigger macOS notification from container via host communication
3. Test with actual sound file playbook, not just visual indicators

**Last 2 Messages to Include in Context**:

Message 1 (My response about container completion):
"## ✅ Container Customization Complete! I've successfully integrated your ~/.zshrc customizations into the Docker container. The container now mirrors your shell environment while being container-compatible!"

Message 2 (Jake's feedback):
"No, your solution doesn't actually result in a sound playing. Please now switch gears for a handover: @-/agent-context-save.md"

**Next Agent Should**: Focus on Docker audio/sound permissions to make Notify_Jake actually play audible sound in containers.
