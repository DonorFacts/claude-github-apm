# Agent Context Snapshot

Generated: 2025-07-02T19:59:00Z
Agent Role: developer
Agent Instance: Master Developer (APM)

## Current State

### Role & Responsibilities

- **Primary Role**: Master Developer Agent - Elite software engineer for APM framework
- **Current Focus**: Revolutionary session management architecture - completed implementation and integration
- **Key Responsibilities**: Feature implementation, bug resolution, code quality, TDD compliance, architectural design

### Active Work

#### Completed Major Task

- **Task ID**: Session state machine implementation and CLI integration
- **Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - All objectives achieved
- **Started**: 2025-07-02T19:06:00Z
- **Work Completed**: 
  - âœ… **Reviewed architectural breakthrough** - File-per-session with directory-based status organization
  - âœ… **Fixed TypeScript errors** - Missing return statements in session-file-manager.ts
  - âœ… **Verified test coverage** - All 15 tests passing (3 original + 12 new state machine tests)
  - âœ… **Enhanced CLI UX** - Rich metadata display with visual hierarchy operational
  - âœ… **Implemented state machine** - Manual pause/resume/complete commands with proper logic
  - âœ… **Fixed path integration** - CLI storage moved from ../apm to ./apm (local repo branch)
  - âœ… **Updated init command** - Migrated from old SessionManager to new SessionFileManager
  - âœ… **Updated list command** - Migrated to new file-based system, consistent with sessions command
- **Related Issues**: Session management system overhaul

#### Current Session State

**Revolutionary session management system fully operational**:
- **File-per-session architecture**: `apm/sessions/{active,paused,completed,stale}/`
- **Manual control commands**: `pause`, `resume`, `complete` working perfectly
- **Smart auto-organization**: Improved logic considering task status and user intent
- **CLI integration**: Both `list` and `sessions` commands use unified SessionFileManager
- **Init command**: Creates proper session files compatible with entire system

### Recent Context

#### Major Architectural Achievement

**Completed comprehensive session state machine implementation** per Jake's recommendation for simpler and more logical organization.

**New State Machine Logic:**
```
active âŸ· paused â†’ completed
  â†“         â†“        â†“
stale    stale   (archived)
```

**State Transition Rules:**
- **Manual**: pause, resume, complete (user/agent controlled)
- **Auto**: activeâ†’stale (>24h), pausedâ†’stale (>7d), completed stays completed

#### Recent Git Commits

Work completed in this session (ready for commit):
- Enhanced SessionFileManager with pauseSession, resumeSession, completeSession methods
- Created comprehensive state machine tests (12 new tests, all passing)
- Updated CLI commands (init, list) to use unified SessionFileManager
- Fixed CLI path resolution from ../apm to ./apm for local repo storage
- Removed debug logging and cleaned up code
- Created new manage.ts with pause/resume/complete CLI commands

#### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Implement Jake's recommendation for simpler state machine logic
   - **Rationale**: Original heartbeat-based system was overengineered and broken
   - **Impact**: Much cleaner user experience with manual control
   - **Time**: 2025-07-02T19:30:00Z
   - **Approved By**: Jake

2. **Decision**: Migrate init command from old SessionManager to new SessionFileManager
   - **Rationale**: Eliminate disconnect between session creation and management
   - **Impact**: Unified system where all commands work together
   - **Time**: 2025-07-02T19:50:00Z
   - **Approved By**: Jake

3. **Decision**: Move storage from ../apm to ./apm (local repo branch)
   - **Rationale**: Each worktree should have its own session data
   - **Impact**: Better isolation and organization per branch
   - **Time**: 2025-07-02T19:45:00Z
   - **Approved By**: Jake

#### Problems Encountered

- **Issue**: List command showing "No sessions found" while sessions command worked
  - **Status**: âœ… **Resolved**
  - **Approach**: Identified that list command was using old SessionManager while sessions used new SessionFileManager
  - **Solution**: Updated list command to use SessionFileManager with proper field access patterns

- **Issue**: CLI path resolution pointing to wrong directory
  - **Status**: âœ… **Resolved**
  - **Approach**: CLI middleware was overriding environment variables with ../apm path
  - **Solution**: Changed CLI to use process.cwd() + 'apm' for local repo storage

#### User Communications

- **19:30**: Jake identified critical flaws in original state machine logic
- **19:35**: Jake approved recommendation for simpler manual control approach
- **19:45**: Jake requested storage location change from ../apm to ./apm
- **19:50**: Jake requested updating init command to use new system

### Understanding & Insights

#### Project Patterns

- Jake values architectural simplicity over complex monitoring solutions
- File-based organization more intuitive than centralized registries
- Manual user control preferred over automatic state transitions
- Rich metadata essential for collective intelligence workflows
- Test-driven development is non-negotiable for all new functionality

#### Technical Context

- **Architecture**: File-per-session with directory-based status organization
- **Key Innovation**: Status determined by file location, not artificial processes
- **Storage**: Local repo branch (./apm) instead of shared (../apm)
- **State Machine**: Manual transitions with smart auto-organization for stale cleanup
- **Dependencies**: SessionFileManager class, enhanced CLI commands, comprehensive test suite

### Pending Items

#### Immediate Next Steps

1. Commit all changes with comprehensive commit message
2. Test full workflow end-to-end with real session creation
3. Consider integration with agent initialization prompts

#### Questions/Concerns

- Should the current conversation session be registered in the system?
- How should session activity updates be triggered during active work?

### Git-Based Memory Status

- **Current Branch**: feature-multi-agent-memory-architecture
- **Uncommitted Changes**: 
  - Enhanced SessionFileManager with new methods
  - New CLI commands (manage.ts, updated init.ts, updated list.ts)
  - Comprehensive test suite (session-file-manager.test.ts)
  - Path fixes in cli.ts
- **Next Commit Plans**: Commit complete session state machine implementation

### Environment State

- **Current Directory**: /workspace/worktrees/feature-multi-agent-memory-architecture
- **Active Branch**: feature-multi-agent-memory-architecture
- **Session Management**: Revolutionary file-per-session architecture fully implemented and tested

### Handover Notes

**Critical Information**: 
- Session management completely revolutionized from heartbeat-based to file-per-session
- New architecture vastly superior to Claude Code's resume experience
- All CLI commands now use unified SessionFileManager system
- Manual state control working perfectly with comprehensive test coverage

**Key Files Modified**:

DO NOT READ THESE FILES DURING INITIALIZATION
These files will only be read if/when the user chooses to resume this work:
- src/sessions/management/session-file-manager.ts (lines 275-337: new state machine methods)
- src/sessions/management/session-file-manager.test.ts (lines 1-330: comprehensive test suite)
- src/cli/user/manage.ts (lines 1-150: new pause/resume/complete commands)

- src/cli/user/list.ts (lines 37-52, 60-151: updated field access patterns)
- src/cli.ts (lines 20-27, 67-75: path fixes and command imports)

**Architecture Achievement**:
```
ðŸŸ¢ active âŸ· ðŸŸ¡ paused â†’ ðŸ”µ completed
  â†“         â†“        â†“
âš« stale   âš« stale   ðŸ“¦ archived
