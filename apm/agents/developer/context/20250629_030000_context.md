# Agent Context Snapshot

Generated: 2025-06-29T03:00:00Z
Agent Role: developer
Agent Instance: Master Developer - Docker Integration & Git Worktree Merge

## Current State

### Role & Responsibilities

- **Primary Role**: Master Developer implementing features and maintaining code quality
- **Current Focus**: Completed Docker/git worktree merge, ready for main PR
- **Key Responsibilities**: Feature implementation, bug resolution, code quality, documentation

### Active Work

#### Current Task

- **Task ID**: Docker containerization merge
- **Status**: completed
- **Started**: 2025-06-29
- **Work Completed**: 
  - ✅ Created concurrent watch script (`pnpm start`)
  - ✅ Made terminal emoji required for containers
  - ✅ Merged test-docker-setup into feature-draft-git-worktree-docs
  - ✅ Resolved merge conflicts in .gitignore
  - ✅ Verified all Docker features integrated
- **Work Remaining**: None - ready for PR to main
- **Related Issues**: #docker-integration #git-worktree #container-ux

### Recent Context

#### Recent Git Commits

- d5531ff: merge: integrate Docker containerization features from test-docker-setup
- 78b59e8: chore: add runtime queue files to gitignore
- 862c970: feat: add container-git wrapper for worktree compatibility
- 763f5de: chore: add settings.local.json to gitignore
- b6b2d7d: feat: require emoji in container terminal titles
- 8c66fae: refactor: improve concurrent watch script and rename to start

#### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Use full merge instead of cherry-pick for Docker features
   - **Rationale**: Preserves valuable development history and context
   - **Impact**: 37 commits ahead of origin, comprehensive feature set
   - **Time**: 2025-06-29 02:50
   - **Approved By**: Jake

2. **Decision**: Add runtime queue files to .gitignore
   - **Rationale**: Runtime files don't belong in version control
   - **Impact**: Cleaner repository, no accidental commits
   - **Time**: 2025-06-29 02:45
   - **Approved By**: Jake

#### Problems Encountered

- **Issue**: Git worktree paths incompatible between host/container
  - **Status**: Resolved with container-git wrapper
  - **Approach**: Wrapper translates paths during git operations
  - **GitHub Issue**: Not tracked

- **Issue**: Branch mismatch (test-docker-setup vs feature-draft-git-worktree-docs)
  - **Status**: Resolved by switching branches and merging
  - **Approach**: Identified previous work done on wrong branch
  - **GitHub Issue**: Not tracked

#### User Communications

- 02:30: Jake requested merging Docker features using Option 2 (full merge)
- 02:40: Jake confirmed runtime files should be gitignored
- 02:45: Jake reminded to use pnpm (not npm/yarn)

### Understanding & Insights

#### Project Patterns

- Container-git wrapper essential for Docker worktree operations
- Runtime files (.local/sound-queue, .local/speech-queue) need gitignoring
- Branch names should match worktree directory names
- Full merges preserve valuable development context

#### Technical Context

- **Architecture**: Docker containers with file-based IPC for audio/speech
- **Constraints**: Path mismatches require wrapper scripts
- **Dependencies**: Host daemons for audio/speech processing
- **Container Features**: Auto-rebuild on Dockerfile changes

### Pending Items

#### Immediate Next Steps

1. Create PR from feature-draft-git-worktree-docs to main
2. Include comprehensive description of Docker features
3. Highlight both Docker work and git documentation updates

#### Questions/Concerns

- Should we squash commits or preserve full history in PR?
- Any specific PR reviewers to tag?

### Environment State

- **Current Directory**: /workspace
- **Active Branch**: feature-draft-git-worktree-docs
- **Modified Files**: None (all committed)
- **Container Status**: Running with git wrapper

### Handover Notes

**Critical Information**: 
- Branch contains BOTH Docker features AND git worktree docs
- 37 commits ahead includes ~28 Docker commits from test-docker-setup
- All features tested and working

**Watch Out For**: 
- Use container-git wrapper for all git operations in container
- settings.local.json should stay gitignored
- Runtime queue files are created by daemons

**Recommended Approach**:
1. Create comprehensive PR description listing all features
2. Consider interactive rebase if commit cleanup needed
3. Tag appropriate reviewers familiar with Docker

**Key Files to Review**:
```
DO NOT READ THESE FILES DURING INITIALIZATION
These files will only be read if/when the user chooses to resume this work:
- src/scripts/watch-all.sh (concurrent process runner)
- .local/bin/container-git (git wrapper for containers)
- src/prompts/agents/init.md (terminal emoji requirements)
- .gitignore (runtime files and settings)
- package.json (pnpm start script)
```

## Recovery Instructions

To restore this context:
1. Read only init files, MEMORY.md, and this context during init
2. Present Docker merge completion and PR readiness
3. If user wants to continue, read the specific files listed
4. Help create PR to main with all features
