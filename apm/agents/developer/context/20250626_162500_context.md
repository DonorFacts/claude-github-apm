# Agent Context Snapshot

Generated: 2025-06-26T16:25:00Z
Agent Role: developer
Agent Instance: claude-dev-001

## Current State

### Role & Responsibilities

- **Primary Role**: Master Developer Agent
- **Current Focus**: Multi-agent memory architecture design and implementation
- **Key Responsibilities**: System architecture, TDD implementation, documentation, agent coordination

### Active Work

#### Current Task

- **Task ID**: Build InstanceMemoryManager with TDD approach
- **Status**: pending (design complete, ready for implementation)
- **Started**: 2025-06-26T14:30:45Z
- **Work Completed**: 
  - Complete architecture design documents
  - Git-based communication system design
  - Registry structure with active/archive separation
  - Agent instance handoff strategy
- **Work Remaining**: 
  - TypeScript types and interfaces
  - InstanceMemoryManager implementation
  - CLI tools for memory operations
  - Integration tests
- **Related Issues**: N/A (initial design phase)

### Recent Context

#### Recent Git Commits

- Created architecture documentation files
- Established agent registry structure
- Set up initial directory structure

#### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Use git-based synchronization instead of symlinks
   - **Rationale**: Cross-platform compatibility, audit trail, conflict resolution
   - **Impact**: Robust cross-worktree coordination without platform dependencies
   - **Time**: 2025-06-26T15:30:00Z
   - **Approved By**: User

2. **Decision**: Individual .md files for registry instead of JSON
   - **Rationale**: Faster discovery, self-documenting, human-readable
   - **Impact**: Better agent coordination and oversight capabilities
   - **Time**: 2025-06-26T16:15:00Z
   - **Approved By**: User

3. **Decision**: Preserve instance IDs across context handoffs
   - **Rationale**: Communication continuity, mental model consistency
   - **Impact**: Seamless handoff experience for users and agents
   - **Time**: 2025-06-26T16:10:00Z
   - **Approved By**: User

#### Problems Encountered

- **Issue**: Initial symlink approach had cross-platform limitations
  - **Status**: Resolved
  - **Approach**: Switched to git-based synchronization
  - **GitHub Issue**: N/A

#### User Communications

Recent important exchanges:

- 14:30: User requested multi-agent memory architecture design
- 15:00: Clarified requirements for cross-worktree coordination
- 15:30: Approved git-based approach over symlinks
- 16:00: Approved individual .md registry files approach
- 16:15: Approved instance ID preservation strategy

### Understanding & Insights

#### Project Patterns

- User prefers practical, proven solutions over complex architectures
- Strong emphasis on cross-platform compatibility
- Values audit trails and transparency in agent operations
- Favors file-based approaches for simplicity and debugging

#### Technical Context

- **Architecture**: Git worktree-based development with multiple agent instances
- **Constraints**: Claude Code directory limitations, no symlink dependencies
- **Dependencies**: Git, TypeScript, existing APM framework
- **GitHub Integration**: Standard git workflow with specialized commit prefixes

### Pending Items

#### Immediate Next Steps

1. Implement core TypeScript types and interfaces
2. Build InstanceMemoryManager with TDD approach
3. Create CLI tools for communication and sync

#### Waiting For

- User approval to begin implementation phase

#### Questions/Concerns

- None currently - architecture is well-defined and approved

### Git-Based Memory Status

- **Last Commit**: Architecture documentation and registry setup
- **Uncommitted Changes**: Registry entry, context files
- **Next Commit Plans**: Initial TypeScript implementation

### Environment State

- **Current Directory**: /Users/jakedetels/www/claude-github-apm/worktrees/feature-multi-agent-memory-architecture
- **Active Branch**: feature-multi-agent-memory-architecture
- **Modified Files**: Registry entry, context files

### Handover Notes

For next agent instance:

- **Critical Information**: Complete architecture docs in docs/ directory, ready for TDD implementation
- **Watch Out For**: Ensure TDD principles followed (tests first, verify failure, implement)
- **Recommended Approach**: Start with core types, then InstanceMemoryManager, follow with CLI tools
- **Key Files to Review**: docs/agent-memory.md, docs/inter-agent-communication.md
- **Work in Progress**: Registry system established, ready for TypeScript implementation

**IMPORTANT**: List exact file paths for reference, but mark them clearly:

```
DO NOT READ THESE FILES DURING INITIALIZATION
These files will only be read if/when the user chooses to resume this work:
- src/memory/types/index.ts (lines TBD: implementing core types)
- src/memory/core/InstanceMemoryManager.ts (lines TBD: main implementation)
- docs/agent-memory.md (context for architecture)
- docs/inter-agent-communication.md (context for communication system)
```

This ensures the next instance knows what files are relevant but won't automatically read them during init.
