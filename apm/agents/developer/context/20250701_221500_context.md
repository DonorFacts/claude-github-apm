# Agent Context Snapshot

Generated: 2025-07-01T22:15:00Z
Agent Role: developer
Agent Instance: APM Collective Intelligence Implementation

## Current State

### Role & Responsibilities

- **Primary Role**: Developer implementing APM Collective Intelligence architecture
- **Current Focus**: Crash recovery system foundation - session tracking and CLI
- **Key Responsibilities**: 
  - Build session registry and heartbeat tracking
  - Implement APM CLI for session management
  - Create crash detection and recovery mechanisms
  - Follow TDD practices and maintain existing repo structure

### Active Work

#### Current Task

- **Task ID**: APM Multi-Agent Memory Architecture - Hour 1 Implementation
- **Status**: completed
- **Started**: 2025-07-01T22:00:00Z
- **Work Completed**:
  - Built complete APM CLI foundation (`src/scripts/apm/apm`)
  - Implemented session registry system with JSON storage
  - Created heartbeat tracking and staleness detection
  - Built list command with active/crashed session filtering
  - Created comprehensive demo plan and supporting scripts
  - Moved scripts to proper `src/scripts/` location per repo conventions
- **Work Remaining**: Recovery commands, VS Code integration, conversation search
- **Related Issues**: APM Multi-Agent Memory Architecture

#### Work in Progress

Session registry working with external storage:
- Sessions tracked in `../apm/sessions/registry.json`
- Automatic staleness detection (>2 minutes = crashed)
- Rich metadata: role, specialization, worktree, branch, timestamps

### Recent Context

#### Recent Git Commits

- 4c9a6da: feat: complete APM Collective Intelligence architecture design
- 356ac14: docs: consolidate architecture docs and preserve insights

#### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Use external storage (`../apm/`) for large conversations, repo storage (`./apm/`) for committed knowledge
   - **Rationale**: Conversations too large for repo, but memories/summaries should be committed
   - **Impact**: Clean separation of transient vs persistent data
   - **Time**: During architecture review
   - **Approved By**: Jake (user feedback)

2. **Decision**: Move scripts from `apm/scripts/` to `src/scripts/apm/`
   - **Rationale**: Follow existing repo conventions, keep source code in src/
   - **Impact**: Maintains clean project structure
   - **Time**: During demo creation
   - **Approved By**: Jake (explicit instruction)

#### Problems Encountered

- **Issue**: Session counter variables lost in bash subshell (while loop)
  - **Status**: Resolved
  - **Approach**: Used temporary files for counter persistence

#### User Communications

- User excited to work collaboratively on implementation
- User corrected folder structure (scripts belong in src/)
- User wants to review changes before commits
- User requested demo plan creation

### Understanding & Insights

#### Project Patterns

- Jake values proper folder structure and repo conventions
- Jake wants to see incremental progress and review changes
- Jake expects working demos, not just theoretical designs
- Jake prefers collaborative implementation approach

#### Technical Context

- **Architecture**: Ephemeral agents with collective memory + crash recovery
- **Constraints**: Must work with existing VS Code + worktree workflow
- **Dependencies**: jq for JSON processing, bash for shell operations
- **Storage**: External for conversations, repo for memories/scripts

### Pending Items

#### Immediate Next Steps

1. Implement heartbeat command for agents to update status
2. Build recover command for session restoration
3. Add VS Code terminal integration for recovery
4. Test end-to-end crash recovery workflow

### Git-Based Memory Status

- **Last Commit**: 356ac14 - docs: consolidate architecture docs and preserve insights
- **Uncommitted Changes**: 
  - src/scripts/apm/ (moved from apm/scripts/)
  - docs/demo-plans/ (new demo plan and scripts)
- **Next Commit Plans**: Commit script relocation and demo plans

### Environment State

- **Current Directory**: /workspace/worktrees/feature-multi-agent-memory-architecture
- **Active Branch**: feature-multi-agent-memory-architecture
- **Modified Files**: Script moves, new demo files
- **External Storage**: ../apm/sessions/registry.json with 3 test sessions

### Handover Notes

**Critical Information**: 
- **MAJOR MILESTONE**: APM CLI foundation complete and working
- Session tracking operational with test data
- Demo plan ready for user execution
- Scripts properly relocated to src/scripts/apm/

**Key Files**:
```
DO NOT READ THESE FILES DURING INITIALIZATION
- src/scripts/apm/apm (main CLI entry point)
- src/scripts/apm/commands/list.sh (session listing)
- src/scripts/apm/lib/common.sh (shared functions)
- docs/demo-plans/crash-recovery-demo.md (complete demo plan)
```

**Work Status**: Hour 1 complete - CLI foundation solid, demo ready, ready for Hour 2 recovery implementation
