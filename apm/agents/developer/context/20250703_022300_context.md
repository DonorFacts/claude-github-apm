Agent Role: developer
Agent Instance: Session Monitoring & Claude Code Integration Specialist

## Current State

### Role & Responsibilities

- **Primary Role**: Developer implementing APM session monitoring and Claude Code integration
- **Current Focus**: Validated session monitoring scripts and discovered major integration opportunities
- **Key Responsibilities**: 
  - Validate session monitoring shell scripts for container/host compatibility
  - Simplify Claude Code integration architecture using mounted ~/.claude
  - Identify and document integration gaps in existing APM session management system

### Active Work

#### Current Task

- **Task ID**: Session monitoring script validation and Claude Code integration architecture
- **Status**: completed (validation), pending (integration work)
- **Started**: 2025-07-03T01:00:00Z
- **Work Completed**: 
  - Successfully validated 6 session monitoring shell scripts work in both container and host
  - Simplified path access logic throughout codebase using mounted ~/.claude discovery
  - Created comprehensive test suite (test-session-scripts.sh)
  - Built Claude Code bridge system (claude-code-bridge.ts, uuid-capture.ts)
  - Documented container test results and validation process
- **Work Remaining**: Integration work to unify dual session management systems
- **Related Issues**: APM Multi-Agent Memory Architecture

#### Work in Progress

Integration opportunities identified but not yet implemented:

```typescript
// INTEGRATION GAP: Dual session systems need reconciliation
// 1. Registry-based: sessions/management/ (YAML files in directories)
// 2. Shell-based: sessions/monitoring/ (.jsonl manifests) 
// 3. My new: claude-code-bridge.ts (bridge mappings)

// Need to unify these into single session tracking architecture
```

### Recent Context

#### Recent Git Commits

- 9ff2178: refactor: simplify session monitoring scripts for mounted ~/.claude access
- b84ff18: feat: implement Claude Code SDK hybrid integration
- d766090: chore: save developer context - session tracking debug in progress
- 1c19f60: fix: replace shell scripts with TypeScript for npm start

#### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Use mounted ~/.claude directory for direct access instead of complex path translation
   - **Rationale**: ~/.claude is already mounted in container, eliminating need for host/container bridge logic
   - **Impact**: Simplified entire session monitoring architecture, removed eval echo complexity
   - **Time**: 2025-07-03T02:00:00Z
   - **Approved By**: Jake (user confirmed understanding)

2. **Decision**: Create comprehensive test suite for session monitoring scripts
   - **Rationale**: Scripts had no tests, needed validation for container/host compatibility
   - **Impact**: Discovered scripts work in both environments, validated real Claude Code data access
   - **Time**: 2025-07-03T01:30:00Z
   - **Approved By**: Jake (user requested validation)

3. **Decision**: Simplify UUID capture to use direct JSONL scanning
   - **Rationale**: Complex environment variable detection was unnecessary with mounted ~/.claude
   - **Impact**: More reliable UUID detection, cleaner architecture
   - **Time**: 2025-07-03T02:15:00Z
   - **Approved By**: Technical decision based on mounted filesystem discovery

#### Problems Encountered

- **Issue**: Session test environment crashed due to process spawning (ps command not available in container)
  - **Status**: Resolved
  - **Approach**: Created safer test approach, avoided process monitoring in container tests

- **Issue**: Host validation showed terminal title script doesn't work on macOS
  - **Status**: Pending
  - **Approach**: Identified as non-critical for core functionality

#### User Communications

- 2025-07-03T01:15:00Z: User questioned if container-to-host scripts needed for ~/.claude access
- 2025-07-03T01:45:00Z: User requested host validation tests with specific steps
- 2025-07-03T02:20:00Z: User asked about integration with existing src/sessions/* files
- 2025-07-03T02:22:00Z: User requested context save and full commit of remaining work

### Understanding & Insights

#### Project Patterns

- **Container Architecture**: ~/.claude is mounted, making host/container path translation unnecessary
- **Testing Approach**: User prefers manual validation steps over fully automated tests for speed
- **Commit Patterns**: User wants comprehensive commits with detailed messages following git-commit.md guide

#### Technical Context

- **Architecture**: Discovered major integration opportunity - 3 separate session systems that need unification
- **Constraints**: Must maintain backward compatibility with existing CLI commands (13 files use session managers)
- **Dependencies**: Heavy integration between session management and CLI system
- **Claude Code Integration**: Direct access to JSONL files enables much simpler architecture

### Pending Items

#### Immediate Next Steps

1. **CRITICAL**: Unify the three session management systems:
   - Registry-based (sessions/management/ - YAML in directories)
   - Shell-based (sessions/monitoring/ - .jsonl manifests)
   - Bridge-based (my claude-code-bridge.ts - bridge mappings)

2. **Update existing hooks and managers** to use simplified ~/.claude access patterns

3. **Integrate new Claude Code bridge** with existing SessionFileManager system

4. **Consolidate session storage** - choose single approach (YAML vs JSONL)

#### Integration Architecture Needed

**MAJOR FINDING**: src/sessions/* contains comprehensive, actively-used APM session management:

- **13 CLI commands** depend on session managers
- **Hooks system** for automatic activity tracking
- **Multiple storage formats** creating confusion
- **My work created additional bridge layer** instead of integrating with existing

**Integration Plan Required**:
1. Analyze which session approach to standardize on
2. Migrate all systems to use mounted ~/.claude patterns
3. Unify session tracking into single source of truth
4. Update CLI commands to use consolidated system

#### Questions/Concerns

- **Storage Format**: Should we standardize on YAML (current SessionFileManager) or JSONL (shell scripts)?
- **Backward Compatibility**: How to migrate existing session data during consolidation?
- **CLI Integration**: 13 files use SessionFileManager - impact of changes?

### Git-Based Memory Status

- **Last Commit**: 9ff2178 - refactor: simplify session monitoring scripts for mounted ~/.claude access
- **Uncommitted Changes**: Multiple files need to be committed (CLI changes, session management updates, context files)
- **Next Commit Plans**: Commit everything remaining with comprehensive message about integration discovery

### Environment State

- **Current Directory**: /workspace/worktrees/feature-multi-agent-memory-architecture
- **Active Branch**: feature-multi-agent-memory-architecture
- **Modified Files**: Multiple uncommitted changes throughout CLI and session systems
- **External Storage**: apm/sessions/ directory with test data

### Handover Notes

**Critical Information**: 
- **MAJOR DISCOVERY**: Three separate session management systems need integration
- **Architecture Insight**: ~/.claude is mounted, simplifying all access patterns
- **Production Impact**: 13 CLI commands actively use session managers - changes affect whole system

**Integration Gaps Identified**:
1. **Dual Session Systems**: Registry-based (YAML) vs Shell-based (.jsonl) vs Bridge-based
2. **Missing Integration**: My claude-code-bridge.ts doesn't integrate with existing SessionFileManager
3. **Path Inconsistencies**: Not all components use simplified ~/.claude access patterns
4. **Storage Fragmentation**: Multiple formats and locations for session data

**Key Files Currently Modified**:

```
DO NOT READ THESE FILES DURING INITIALIZATION
Files with uncommitted changes that need to be committed:
- src/sessions/management/manager.ts (existing session manager)
- src/cli/user/init.ts (CLI integration points)
- src/cli/user/list.ts (session listing functionality)
- Multiple other CLI files using session managers
- apm/agents/developer/context/* (context files)
- CLAUDE.md (updated project instructions)
```

**Recommended Next Phase**:
1. **Commit current work** (session monitoring validation completed)
2. **Design integration architecture** for unifying session systems
3. **Implement consolidated session management** using ~/.claude insights
4. **Update all CLI commands** to use unified system
5. **Migrate existing session data** to chosen format

**Work Status**: Session monitoring validation complete, major integration opportunity discovered and documented
