## Agent Details
- **Role**: Master Developer  
- **Branch**: feature-multi-agent-memory-architecture
- **Instance ID**: claude-dev-001
- **Work Area**: Multi-agent memory system design

## Current Focus
Designing and implementing git-based multi-agent memory architecture enabling cross-worktree coordination. Completed comprehensive design documents for:

1. **Memory Architecture**: Git-synchronized .md files with active/archive registry structure, instance ID preservation across context handoffs
2. **Communication System**: Cross-branch messaging via git commits with unique naming conventions, 5-minute background sync
3. **Registry System**: Self-documenting .md files encoding role, branch, work area in filenames for fast discovery
4. **TDD Implementation Plan**: Ready to implement TypeScript CLI tools with test-driven development approach

Next: Build InstanceMemoryManager and communication CLI tools following TDD principles.

## User Context  
Working on foundational APM infrastructure. User wants robust, scalable coordination between agent instances across git worktrees without symlink dependencies.
