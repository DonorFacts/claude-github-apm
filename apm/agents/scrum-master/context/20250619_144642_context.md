Agent Role: scrum-master
Agent Instance: Primary

## Current State

### Role & Responsibilities

- **Primary Role**: APM Scrum Master Agent - bridging strategic planning and tactical execution through GitHub's issue tracking system
- **Current Focus**: Completed comprehensive TDD testing for bulk issue creation tool
- **Key Responsibilities**:
  - Converting Implementation Plans to GitHub issue hierarchies
  - Managing issue relationships and dependencies
  - Optimizing API usage for bulk operations
  - Ensuring proper issue type usage and formatting
  - Following TDD practices for tool development

### Active Work

#### Current Task

- **Task ID**: Testing bulk issue creation tool
- **Status**: completed
- **Started**: 2025-06-19T21:00:00Z
- **Work Completed**:
  - Designed comprehensive test plan covering happy path and edge cases
  - Set up Jest test infrastructure with TypeScript support
  - Created test utilities and mock implementations
  - Wrote 24 comprehensive tests following TDD practices
  - Fixed TypeScript configuration issues
  - Achieved 100% test passing rate
  - Created documentation (README.md and TEST_PLAN.md)
- **Work Remaining**: None - testing complete
- **Related Issues**: #8 (Implement issue hierarchy management)

#### Work in Progress

All work completed. The bulk issue creator now has:
- Full test coverage (8 happy path tests, 16 edge case tests)
- Proper TypeScript configuration
- Mock implementations for testing
- Comprehensive error handling
- Documentation

### Recent Context

#### Recent Git Commits

- Working in feature/8-test-bulk-issue-creation worktree
- No commits made during this session yet
- Ready to commit all test files and documentation

#### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Use TDD approach for bulk issue creator testing
   - **Rationale**: Ensures comprehensive coverage and reliable implementation
   - **Impact**: Higher quality code with confidence in error handling
   - **Time**: 2025-06-19T21:00:00Z
   - **Approved By**: User

2. **Decision**: Separate test files for happy path vs edge cases
   - **Rationale**: Better organization and clarity of test scenarios
   - **Impact**: Easier to maintain and understand test suite
   - **Time**: 2025-06-19T21:05:00Z
   - **Approved By**: Implementation decision

3. **Decision**: Use mock implementations for GitHub API
   - **Rationale**: Unit tests should not make real API calls
   - **Impact**: Fast, reliable tests without external dependencies
   - **Time**: 2025-06-19T21:02:00Z
   - **Approved By**: Best practice

4. **Decision**: Use pnpm instead of npm
   - **Rationale**: User preference for package management
   - **Impact**: Consistent with project standards
   - **Time**: 2025-06-19T21:03:00Z
   - **Approved By**: User

#### Problems Encountered

- **Issue**: TypeScript compilation errors due to missing types and wrong target
  - **Status**: Resolved
  - **Approach**: Fixed tsconfig.json, installed @types packages, removed duplicate files
  - **GitHub Issue**: N/A - development issue

- **Issue**: Duplicate files with different casing (bulk-issue-creator.ts vs BulkIssueCreator.ts)
  - **Status**: Resolved
  - **Approach**: Removed lowercase versions to maintain consistency
  - **GitHub Issue**: N/A - cleanup issue

#### User Communications

- 21:00: User requested TDD approach for testing bulk issue creator
- 21:03: User specified to use pnpm instead of npm
- 21:10: User showed TypeScript errors via IDE diagnostics
- 21:15: User requested context save

### Understanding & Insights

#### Project Patterns

- TDD is strongly preferred for all new development
- TypeScript strict mode is enforced
- Comprehensive error handling is expected
- Documentation should be created alongside code
- Test cleanup is critical (delete test issues)

#### Technical Context

- **Architecture**: TypeScript-based tools with full type safety
- **Constraints**: Must use mocks for external dependencies in unit tests
- **Dependencies**: Jest with ts-jest for testing, pnpm for package management
- **GitHub Integration**: GraphQL batching limited to 20 issues per call

### Pending Items

#### Immediate Next Steps

1. Commit all test files and documentation
2. Consider running integration tests with actual GitHub API (in test repo)
3. Update Implementation Plan if any learnings affect the approach

#### Waiting For

- None - all work completed

#### Questions/Concerns

- Should we create integration tests that use a real test repository?
- Are there any other edge cases we should consider testing?

### Git-Based Memory Status

- **Last Commit**: None in this session
- **Uncommitted Changes**: 
  - New test files (BulkIssueCreator.test.ts, BulkIssueCreator.edge-cases.test.ts)
  - Test utilities and setup files
  - TypeScript configuration files
  - README.md documentation
  - TEST_PLAN.md
  - Package.json updates
- **Next Commit Plans**: Commit all test implementation with message referencing TDD completion

### Environment State

- **Current Directory**: /Users/jakedetels/www/claude-github-apm/worktrees/feature-8-test-bulk-issue-creation
- **Open Files**: Multiple test files and configuration files
- **Modified Files**: See uncommitted changes above
- **Active Branch**: feature-8-test-bulk-issue-creation (worktree)

### Handover Notes

If context is for handover:

- **Critical Information**: All 24 tests are passing, TypeScript compilation is clean
- **Watch Out For**: Ensure test files are committed before running bulk issue creator on real repos
- **Recommended Approach**: Consider integration tests as next step
- **Key Files to Review**:
  - src/tools/bulk-issue-creator/__tests__/BulkIssueCreator.test.ts
  - src/tools/bulk-issue-creator/__tests__/BulkIssueCreator.edge-cases.test.ts
  - src/tools/bulk-issue-creator/__tests__/test-utils.ts
  - src/tools/bulk-issue-creator/TEST_PLAN.md
  - src/tools/bulk-issue-creator/README.md
