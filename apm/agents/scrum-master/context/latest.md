# Agent Context Snapshot

Generated: 2025-06-19T18:45:00Z
Agent Role: scrum-master
Agent Instance: Primary

## Current State

### Role & Responsibilities

- **Primary Role**: APM Scrum Master Agent - bridging strategic planning and tactical execution through GitHub's issue tracking system
- **Current Focus**: Testing and implementing bulk issue creation tool for efficient GitHub issue management
- **Key Responsibilities**:
  - Converting Implementation Plans to GitHub issue hierarchies
  - Managing issue relationships and dependencies
  - Optimizing API usage for bulk operations
  - Ensuring proper issue type usage and formatting

### Active Work

#### Current Task

- **Task ID**: #8 - Implement issue hierarchy management
- **Status**: in_progress
- **Started**: 2025-06-19T18:30:00Z
- **Work Completed**:
  - Created TypeScript bulk issue creator tool
  - Designed YAML schema for implementation plans
  - Implemented GraphQL batching for up to 20 issues per API call
  - Created comprehensive documentation
  - Set up feature branch with git worktree
- **Work Remaining**:
  - Test bulk creation with full Implementation Plan
  - Handle any edge cases or errors
  - Optimize performance further if needed
- **Related Issues**: #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7 (already created), #8 (current story)

#### Work in Progress

```typescript
// Bulk issue creator is complete in src/tools/bulk-issue-creator/
// Key features implemented:
// - Batch creation via GraphQL aliases
// - Level-by-level processing
// - Duplicate detection
// - Error handling with fallbacks
// - YAML plan updates after creation
```

### Recent Context

#### Recent Git Commits

- 3a4cce1: docs: add issue #8 to Implementation Plan - Issues: #8
- f6544b5: feat: create bulk issue creator and initial GitHub issues - Issues: #2 #3 #4 #5 #6 #7

#### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Use YAML format for machine-readable implementation plans

   - **Rationale**: YAML provides clean hierarchy representation and is easily parseable
   - **Impact**: Enables automated issue creation from structured plans
   - **Time**: 2025-06-19T17:30:00Z
   - **Approved By**: User

2. **Decision**: Batch issues using GraphQL aliases (20 per call)

   - **Rationale**: Minimize API calls while staying within GitHub's limits
   - **Impact**: Significant performance improvement for large plans
   - **Time**: 2025-06-19T17:45:00Z
   - **Approved By**: Implementation decision

3. **Decision**: Use git worktrees for feature branches
   - **Rationale**: User corrected me on proper git workflow from init.md
   - **Impact**: Parallel development without branch switching
   - **Time**: 2025-06-19T18:40:00Z
   - **Approved By**: User guidance

#### Problems Encountered

- **Issue**: Claude Code security restriction prevents navigation to worktree directories
  - **Status**: Resolved
  - **Approach**: Continue work in main directory, use git commands to manage branches
  - **GitHub Issue**: N/A - tool limitation

#### User Communications

- 18:00: User requested context save before testing bulk creation
- 17:45: User corrected git workflow - must use worktrees not regular branches
- 17:30: User clarified issue title format - no type prefixes in GitHub titles
- 17:00: User requested bulk issue creation tool implementation

### Understanding & Insights

#### Project Patterns

- Issue titles should be clean without type/number prefixes
- Git worktrees are required for feature branches
- Frequent commits are expected per commit.md guidelines
- Implementation Plan serves as source of truth for project structure

#### Technical Context

- **Architecture**: TypeScript-based CLI tools replacing shell scripts
- **Constraints**: Claude Code cannot navigate outside original working directory
- **Dependencies**: GitHub CLI (gh), GraphQL API with issue_types feature
- **GitHub Integration**: Custom issue types (Phase, Project, Epic, Feature, Story, Task, Bug)

### Pending Items

#### Immediate Next Steps

1. Test bulk issue creator with remaining Implementation Plan items
2. Handle any errors or edge cases that arise
3. Update Implementation Plan with all created issue numbers
4. Document any learnings or improvements needed

#### Waiting For

- User guidance on how to proceed with bulk issue creation testing
- Confirmation on which phases/epics to create issues for

#### Questions/Concerns

- Should we create issues for all phases or test incrementally?
- How to handle the worktree limitation in Claude Code?

### Git-Based Memory Status

- **Last Commit**: 3a4cce1 - docs: add issue #8 to Implementation Plan
- **Uncommitted Changes**: None
- **Next Commit Plans**: After bulk issue creation test, commit updated Implementation Plan

### Environment State

- **Current Directory**: /Users/jakedetels/www/claude-github-apm
- **Open Files**: Implementation Plan, bulk issue creator files
- **Modified Files**: None currently
- **Active Branch**: main (worktree created: feature/8-test-bulk-issue-creation)

### Handover Notes

If context is for handover:

- **Critical Information**: Bulk issue creator is ready in src/tools/bulk-issue-creator/
- **Watch Out For**: Worktree at /Users/jakedetels/www/.worktrees/feature-8-test-bulk-issue-creation
- **Recommended Approach**: Run bulk creator from main directory, cherry-pick if needed
- **Key Files to Review**:
  - src/tools/bulk-issue-creator/
  - src/tools/implementation-plan.yaml
  - apm/Implementation_Plan.md

## Recovery Instructions

To restore this context:

1. Load this context file from `apm/agents/scrum-master/context/latest.md`
2. Review recent git commits with `git log --oneline -20`
3. Check GitHub issues #2-8 for context
4. Review any uncommitted changes with `git status`
5. Continue with testing bulk issue creation tool
