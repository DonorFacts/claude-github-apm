Agent Role: scrum-master
Agent Instance: Scrum Master

## Current State

### Role & Responsibilities

- **Primary Role**: APM Scrum Master Agent - Project workflow orchestrator and GitHub integration specialist
- **Current Focus**: Implementing and testing bulk issue creation for Implementation Plan
- **Key Responsibilities**: 
  - Convert Implementation Plans to GitHub issue hierarchies
  - Ensure all work is properly tracked and visible
  - Bridge strategic planning and tactical execution

### Active Work

#### Current Task

- **Task ID**: #8 - Test bulk issue creation
- **Status**: in_progress
- **Started**: 2025-06-19T21:15:00Z
- **Work Completed**: 
  - Created comprehensive TDD tests for markdown to YAML converter
  - Implemented MarkdownToYamlConverter class with full functionality
  - Successfully converted Implementation Plan from markdown to YAML
  - Fixed GitHub API integration to use correct issueTypeId field
  - Created CLI scripts for both conversion and bulk creation
- **Work Remaining**: 
  - Test bulk issue creation with small subset first
  - Run full bulk issue creation for Implementation Plan
  - Handle parent-child relationships after creation
- **Related Issues**: #8, #5, #1

#### Work in Progress

```typescript
// About to test bulk issue creation
// Fixed API calls to use issueTypeId instead of issueTemplate
// Updated YAML to use MDT_Task for doc type (no MDT_Doc type available)
// Ready to run: npx ts-node scripts/bulk-create-issues.ts apm/Implementation_Plan_converted.yaml
```

### Recent Context

#### Recent Git Commits

- 3a18db6: feat: implement markdown to YAML converter for implementation plans - Issues: #8 #5 #1
- 87939e5: chore: initialize scrum master agent session - Issues: #8 #5 #1

#### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Create markdown to YAML converter instead of manual conversion
   - **Rationale**: Reusable tool for future plans, follows TDD approach
   - **Impact**: More flexible solution for various plan structures
   - **Time**: 2025-06-19T21:45:00Z
   - **Approved By**: User

2. **Decision**: Use issueTypeId field in GraphQL mutations
   - **Rationale**: Correct API field based on schema inspection
   - **Impact**: Fixed bulk creation API errors
   - **Time**: 2025-06-19T22:10:00Z
   - **Approved By**: Self (based on API discovery)

#### Problems Encountered

- **Issue**: GitHub API rejected issueTemplate field
  - **Status**: Resolved
  - **Approach**: Discovered correct field is issueTypeId through GraphQL schema query
  - **GitHub Issue**: Related to #8

- **Issue**: Optional doc type in IssueTypes interface
  - **Status**: Resolved
  - **Approach**: Added null checks and used MDT_Task as fallback for doc type
  - **GitHub Issue**: Related to #8

#### User Communications

- 21:15: User requested bulk issue creation for Implementation Plan
- 21:45: User suggested creating TS converter script for flexibility
- 21:50: User reminded to follow TDD approach
- 22:14: User requested context save for handover

### Understanding & Insights

#### Project Patterns

- TDD approach is strongly preferred - tests first, then implementation
- Implementation Plan uses markdown with specific structure (## for phases, ### for epics, numbered lists for tasks)
- Issue types are prefixed in item titles (Phase, Epic, Task, Story, etc.)
- GitHub custom issue types use MDT_ prefix (MDT_Phase, MDT_Epic, etc.)

#### Technical Context

- **Architecture**: Bulk issue creator uses GraphQL batching (20 issues per call)
- **Constraints**: Must include GraphQL-Features header for custom issue types
- **Dependencies**: Uses gh CLI for GitHub API access
- **GitHub Integration**: Repository uses custom issue types, requires issueTypeId field

### Pending Items

#### Immediate Next Steps

1. Create small test YAML file to validate bulk creation works
2. Run bulk issue creation on full Implementation Plan YAML
3. Monitor for any API errors or rate limiting
4. Update YAML file with created issue numbers
5. Create parent-child relationships using shell script

#### Waiting For

- None - ready to proceed with bulk creation

#### Questions/Concerns

- Should test with smaller subset first to ensure no API issues
- Need to verify all 124 items can be created without rate limiting

### Git-Based Memory Status

- **Last Commit**: 3a18db6 - feat: implement markdown to YAML converter for implementation plans
- **Uncommitted Changes**: Multiple files including converter implementation and YAML files
- **Next Commit Plans**: Commit after successful bulk issue creation

### Environment State

- **Current Directory**: /Users/jakedetels/www/claude-github-apm/worktrees/feature-8-test-bulk-issue-creation
- **Open Files**: Implementation_Plan_converted.yaml, BulkIssueCreator.ts, GitHubClient.ts
- **Modified Files**: See git status
- **Active Branch**: feature/8-test-bulk-issue-creation

### Handover Notes

If context is for handover:

- **Critical Information**: Bulk issue creator is ready but untested on live API. Start with small test.
- **Watch Out For**: GitHub API rate limits when creating 124 issues
- **Recommended Approach**: Create test YAML with 3-5 items first, then proceed with full plan
- **Key Files to Review**: 
  - apm/Implementation_Plan_converted.yaml (124 items ready)
  - scripts/bulk-create-issues.ts (CLI entry point)
  - src/tools/bulk-issue-creator/GitHubClient.ts (fixed API calls)

## Recovery Instructions

To restore this context:

1. Load this context file from `apm/agents/scrum-master/context/latest.md`
2. Review recent git commits with `git log --oneline -10`
3. Check GitHub issues referenced in commits (#8, #5, #1)
4. Review any uncommitted changes with `git status`
5. Continue with testing bulk issue creation using small subset first
