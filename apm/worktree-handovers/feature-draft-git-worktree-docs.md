# Handover: feature-draft-git-worktree-docs

## Initialize as Prompt Engineer

Please initialize as the Prompt Engineer agent to continue this work.

## Context

We've been enhancing git worktree documentation and VS Code integration for the APM framework.

## Files Transferred from Main

- `.vscode/tasks.json` - VS Code task configuration for auto-launching Claude
- `open-worktree-vscode.ts` - TypeScript script to open worktrees with Claude
- `src/prompts/git-worktrees.md` - Main worktree documentation (already updated)
- `src/prompts/git-worktrees-uncommitted-changes.md` - Handling uncommitted changes
- `src/prompts/worktree-handover-validation.md` - User validation steps
- `src/prompts/git-worktree-file-transfer.md` - File transfer documentation
- `test-worktree-vscode-integration*.ts` - Test files
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated with auto-handover check rule

## Work Completed

1. Created comprehensive git worktree documentation
2. Added handling for uncommitted changes on wrong branch
3. Implemented VS Code automation with tasks.json
4. Created file transfer process for moving work between branches
5. Established handover system in `apm/worktree-handovers/`

## Next Steps

1. Run `git status` to see all transferred files
2. Review the changes, especially:
   - The new section in `git-worktrees.md` about uncommitted changes
   - The handover automation in `CLAUDE.md`
3. Commit all changes with appropriate message referencing the draft issue
4. Consider creating a proper GitHub issue for this enhancement
5. Test the full workflow end-to-end

## Notes

- The main branch still has unrelated changes (package.json, command-sync, etc.)
- Those changes are NOT part of this feature and should be handled separately
- This feature is self-contained and ready to commit
