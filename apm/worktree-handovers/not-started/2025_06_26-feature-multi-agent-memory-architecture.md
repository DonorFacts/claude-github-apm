# Worktree Handover: feature-multi-agent-memory-architecture

## Agent Initialization

**Role**: developer  
**Initialize with**: `src/prompts/agents/developer/init.md`

## Task Context

**GitHub Issue**: N/A (User-requested feature)  
**Purpose**: Design and implement memory architecture for multi-agent concurrent instances  
**Scope**: Create a distributed file-based memory system supporting isolated short-term memory per instance while enabling knowledge sharing and conversation continuity across instances

## Memory Transfer from Previous Session

### Work Already Completed
- Analyzed existing memory architecture (file-based system using MEMORY.md and context files)
- Researched session lifecycle and monitoring designs in docs/
- Created comprehensive implementation plan prioritizing TypeScript solutions
- Established feature branch and worktree structure

### Current State
- Fresh worktree ready for implementation
- Clear architecture plan approved by user
- Focus on TypeScript-first approach to minimize token usage

### Key Context
- Multi-agent framework requires concurrent instances of same agent type
- Each instance needs isolated short-term memory to prevent interference
- Long-term knowledge should be shared across instances of same type
- Conversation recovery must work across different instances
- Priority on TypeScript implementations over prompts (reduce costs & latency)
- User specifically requested src/memory/ not src/lib/memory/

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Read this handover file completely
2. Initialize as Developer agent with TDD approach
3. Create src/memory/ directory structure
4. Implement core TypeScript types and interfaces
5. Build InstanceMemoryManager with full test coverage
6. Create CLI tools for memory operations
7. Update agent initialization to use new system

## Resources and References

- Existing memory system: apm/agents/<role>/MEMORY.md structure
- Session designs: docs/session-lifecycle-design.md, docs/typescript-session-monitor-design.md
- Event system: apm/events/queue.jsonl pattern
- Agent initialization: src/prompts/agents/init.md

## Special Instructions

### Architecture Requirements
- **Instance Memory**: `apm/agents/<role>/instances/<instance-id>/memory.json`
- **Type Memory**: `apm/agents/<role>/MEMORY.md` (existing)
- **Shared Knowledge**: `apm/agents/<role>/knowledge/`
- **Session Registry**: `apm/sessions/registry.json`

### Key Design Decisions
- Lock-free eventual consistency model for concurrent operations
- File-based message queue for cross-instance communication
- Atomic file operations for safety
- Memory size limits and rotation policies
- Built-in health monitoring and debugging

### Testing Requirements
- Follow TDD: Write tests first, verify they fail, then implement
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for multi-instance scenarios
- Stress tests for concurrent operations
- Target 90%+ test coverage per Superman Developer standards

### TypeScript Execution Pattern
Agents will execute TypeScript files directly:
```bash
tsx src/memory/cli/init-instance.ts
tsx src/memory/cli/save-memory.ts
```

This reduces token usage by ~80% vs prompt-based operations.

## Development Priorities

1. Core infrastructure (types, managers, session handling)
2. CLI tools for agent operations
3. Safety mechanisms (locking, conflict resolution)
4. Cross-instance communication
5. Tests and documentation

Remember: This is a critical infrastructure component. Quality and reliability are paramount.
