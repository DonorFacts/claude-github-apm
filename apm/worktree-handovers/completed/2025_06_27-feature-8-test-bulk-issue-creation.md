# Worktree Handover: feature-8-test-bulk-issue-creation

## Agent Initialization

**Role**: developer  
**Initialize with**: `src/prompts/agents/developer/init.md`

## Task Context

**GitHub Issue**: #8  
**Purpose**: Fix TypeScript compilation errors in bulk issue creation feature  
**Scope**: Resolve all TS errors found when running `pnpm test` while maintaining functionality

## Memory Transfer from Previous Session

### Work Already Completed
- Bulk issue creation feature has been implemented
- Test scripts (test:prod, test:verbose) have been restored to package.json 
- APM_TEST_PROD environment variable support has been added
- Feature branch created and merged test script fixes to main

### Current State
- TypeScript compilation errors exist in the feature branch
- Running `pnpm test` will reveal the specific errors that need fixing
- All dependencies should be installed and ready

### Key Context
- This feature includes production testing capabilities with APM_TEST_PROD=true
- The bulk issue creation functionality is working but has type safety issues
- Test scripts were previously lost during merges but have been restored
- Branch contains comprehensive testing infrastructure including edge cases

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Read this handover file completely
2. Initialize as Developer agent 
3. Run `pnpm test` to identify all TypeScript compilation errors
4. Fix each TS error while preserving functionality
5. Ensure all tests pass after fixes
6. Commit fixes with clear commit messages

## Special Instructions

- Focus on TYPE SAFETY - fix TS errors without breaking functionality
- Preserve all existing test coverage and functionality
- The APM_TEST_PROD environment variable integration must remain working
- After fixing TS errors, run both unit tests and production tests to verify
- Commit each logical group of fixes separately for clean history
