# VS Code Dev Container Security for APM Framework

**Security Enhancement**: Run Claude Code agents in isolated VS Code dev containers with dangerous permissions safely contained while maintaining familiar terminal UX.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop (macOS/Windows) or Docker CE (Linux)
- VS Code with Dev Containers extension

### Create Secure Worktree
```bash
# Standard worktree creation with dev container security (default)
./src/scripts/git/worktree-create.sh feature-123-auth developer "Implement authentication"

# Legacy mode without containers (if needed)
./src/scripts/git/worktree-create.sh feature-123-auth developer "Implement authentication" --no-container
```

### Start Containerized Development
1. VS Code opens worktree automatically
2. VS Code detects `.devcontainer/` and prompts: **"Reopen in Container?"**
3. Click **"Reopen in Container"**
4. Container builds and starts (1-2 minutes first time)
5. Run `claude` in VS Code terminal (same UX as before)

## Benefits

### Security Isolation
- **Host Protection**: Claude cannot access personal files, SSH keys, or system settings
- **Dangerous Permissions**: `--dangerously-skip-permissions` runs safely in container
- **Network Isolation**: Controlled external access
- **Resource Limits**: Prevent system resource exhaustion

### Developer Experience
- **Same VS Code Terminal**: Familiar interface, same keyboard shortcuts
- **Single Claude Instance**: One conversation per worktree window
- **Seamless Integration**: No workflow changes required
- **Agent Memory Persists**: Memory system works identically in containers

## How It Works

### Architecture
```
VS Code (Host)                    Dev Container
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Terminal UI                   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Claude Code instance
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ File explorer                 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Project files (mounted)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Extensions                    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ APM memory (mounted)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Git integration               ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Isolated execution environment
```

### File Structure
```
worktree/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .devcontainer/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ devcontainer.json         # VS Code dev container config
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apm/                          # Memory system (mounted)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agents/                   # Agent memory persists
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ setup/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ container-init.sh     # Container initialization
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project files                 # Mounted read-write
```

## Configuration

### Dev Container Template
The framework automatically generates `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "APM Framework - developer",
  "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/typescript-node:20",
  
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/github-cli:1": {},
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/docker-in-docker:2": {}
  },
  
  "mounts": [
    "source=${localWorkspaceFolder}/apm,target=/workspace/apm,type=bind"
  ],
  
  "containerEnv": {
    "APM_CONTAINERIZED": "true",
    "APM_AGENT_ROLE": "developer",
    "APM_MEMORY_PATH": "/workspace/apm/agents/developer"
  },
  
  "postCreateCommand": "./apm/setup/container-init.sh"
}
```

### Environment Variables
Automatically set in containers:
- `APM_CONTAINERIZED=true`
- `APM_AGENT_ROLE` - Agent role (developer, qa, etc.)
- `APM_MEMORY_PATH` - Path to agent memory
- `APM_PROJECT_ROOT` - Project workspace path
- `REMOTE_CONTAINERS` - VS Code dev container indicator

## UX Flow

### Development Workflow
1. **Create worktree**: `./src/scripts/git/worktree-create.sh feature-branch developer "Description"`
2. **VS Code opens**: Automatically opens worktree in new window
3. **Container prompt**: "Folder contains a Dev Container configuration file. Reopen in Container?"
4. **Click "Reopen in Container"**: VS Code builds and starts container
5. **Same terminal**: VS Code terminal now runs inside container
6. **Start Claude**: Run `claude` command (same as before)
7. **Develop securely**: Full dangerous permissions within container isolation

### Mental Model
- **One VS Code window** = One worktree = One container = One Claude conversation
- **No doubling** of instances or applications
- **Same UX** with container security underneath

## Agent Behavior

### Container Detection
Agents automatically detect containerized environments:
- Terminal titles show üê≥ container indicator
- Memory paths adapt to container mount points (`/workspace/apm/agents/`)
- Initialization confirms container vs. host environment

### Memory System
Identical behavior in containers and host:
- `MEMORY.md` persists across container restarts
- Context saves work seamlessly
- Handover protocols function identically

## Performance

### First-Time Setup
- **Initial build**: 1-2 minutes for container image download and setup
- **Subsequent starts**: 10-30 seconds for container initialization
- **Resource overhead**: ~100-200MB RAM per container

### Ongoing Performance
- **File I/O**: Minimal performance impact from volume mounting
- **Terminal responsiveness**: Identical to native VS Code terminal
- **Claude Code performance**: No noticeable difference

## Troubleshooting

### Container Won't Build
```bash
# Check Docker is running
docker ps

# Verify VS Code Dev Containers extension is installed
code --list-extensions | grep ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers

# Rebuild container
Cmd+Shift+P ‚Üí "Dev Containers: Rebuild Container"
```

### Memory Not Persisting
```bash
# Verify volume mounting in container
ls -la /workspace/apm/agents/

# Check container logs
Cmd+Shift+P ‚Üí "Dev Containers: Show Container Log"
```

### Performance Issues
```bash
# Monitor container resources
docker stats

# Check VS Code performance
Cmd+Shift+P ‚Üí "Developer: Reload Window"
```

## Migration

### From Non-Container to Container
No migration needed - containers are now the default:
```bash
# This now creates containers by default
./src/scripts/git/worktree-create.sh feature-branch

# Add --no-container only if you need legacy mode
./src/scripts/git/worktree-create.sh feature-branch --no-container
```

### Containerize Existing Worktree
To add dev container support to an existing worktree:

```bash
# From main project directory - script handles existing worktrees
./src/scripts/git/worktree-create.sh existing-branch-name developer "Description"
```

This will:
1. Detect the existing worktree
2. Add `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` with proper agent role
3. You can then reopen VS Code and select "Reopen in Container"

### From Legacy Docker to Dev Containers
Existing worktrees with `claude-sandbox.config.json` can be updated:
1. Delete `claude-sandbox.config.json`
2. Re-run the worktree script to generate `.devcontainer/`
3. Reopen in VS Code and select "Reopen in Container"

## Security Notes

### What Dev Containers Protect
- Host file system isolation (only project files accessible)
- SSH key and credential protection
- System configuration isolation
- Resource consumption limits
- Network access controls

### What Dev Containers Don't Protect
- Network-based attacks (configurable via dev container features)
- Container escape vulnerabilities (rare with VS Code dev containers)
- Shared kernel exploits (theoretical)

### Best Practices
- Keep Docker updated for security patches
- Review generated dev container configurations
- Monitor container resource usage
- Use VS Code's built-in security features

## Comparison: Before vs. After

### Before (claude-code-sandbox)
```
1. Run worktree script with --docker flag
2. Manually run claude-sandbox command
3. Switch to web browser at localhost:3456
4. Use web terminal interface
5. Lose VS Code integrations
```

### After (VS Code Dev Containers)
```
1. Run worktree script (containers by default)
2. VS Code prompts "Reopen in Container?"
3. Click "Reopen in Container"
4. Same VS Code terminal interface
5. Run claude command as usual
```

**Result**: Enterprise-grade security isolation with zero UX compromise - same familiar VS Code terminal experience with container protection underneath.

**Key Insight**: The best security is invisible security. Users get protection without changing their workflow.
