# Docker Security Usage for APM Framework

**Security Enhancement**: Run Claude Code agents in isolated Docker containers with dangerous permissions safely contained.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop or Podman installed
- claude-code-sandbox: `pnpm add -g @textcortex/claude-code-sandbox`

### Create Secure Worktree
```bash
# Standard worktree creation
./src/scripts/git/worktree-create.sh feature-123-auth developer "Implement authentication"

# Enhanced with Docker security
./src/scripts/git/worktree-create.sh feature-123-auth developer "Implement authentication" --docker
```

### Start Containerized Development
```bash
# In the worktree directory
claude-sandbox
```

This opens a web terminal at `http://localhost:3456` with Claude Code running in an isolated container.

## Benefits

### Security Isolation
- **Host Protection**: Claude cannot access your personal files, SSH keys, or system settings
- **Dangerous Permissions**: `--dangerously-skip-permissions` runs safely in container
- **Network Isolation**: Controlled external access (optional)
- **Resource Limits**: Prevent system resource exhaustion

### APM Integration
- **Agent Memory Persists**: Memory system works identically in containers
- **Seamless Handovers**: Context transfers between host and container environments  
- **GitHub Integration**: Full workflow automation preserved
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Container and host agents can collaborate

## How It Works

### Architecture
```
Host System (APM Framework)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Worktree management and GitHub integration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Agent coordination and memory persistence
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Docker Container (Secure execution)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Claude Code with dangerous permissions
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Isolated file system
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Mounted APM memory (/apm)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Mounted project files (/workspace)
```

### File Structure
```
worktree/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ claude-sandbox.config.json    # Generated Docker config
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apm/                          # Memory system (mounted)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agents/                   # Agent memory persists
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ setup/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ container-init.sh     # Container initialization
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project files                 # Mounted read-write
```

## Configuration

### APM Docker Config Template
The framework automatically generates `claude-sandbox.config.json`:

```json
{
  "autoPush": false,
  "autoCreatePR": false,
  "setupCommands": [
    "npm install",
    "source ./apm/setup/container-init.sh"
  ],
  "volumes": {
    "apm_memory": "./apm:/apm"
  },
  "environment": {
    "APM_AGENT_ROLE": "developer",
    "APM_WORKTREE": "/path/to/worktree"
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables
Automatically set in containers:
- `APM_CONTAINERIZED=true`
- `APM_AGENT_ROLE` - Agent role (developer, qa, etc.)
- `APM_MEMORY_PATH` - Path to agent memory
- `APM_PROJECT_ROOT` - Project workspace path

## Agent Behavior

### Container Detection
Agents automatically detect containerized environments:
- Terminal titles show üê≥ container indicator
- Memory paths adapt to container mount points
- Initialization confirms container vs. host environment

### Memory System
Identical behavior in containers and host:
- `MEMORY.md` persists across container restarts
- Context saves work seamlessly
- Handover protocols function identically

## Workflows

### Development Workflow
1. **Create worktree with Docker**: `./src/scripts/git/worktree-create.sh feature-branch developer "Description" --docker`
2. **Start container**: `claude-sandbox` in worktree directory
3. **Initialize agent**: Agent detects container and adapts automatically
4. **Develop securely**: Full dangerous permissions within container isolation
5. **Commit and push**: Git operations work normally (mounted volumes)

### Agent Handover
Container-aware handovers work seamlessly:
- Memory transfers between host and container agents
- Context files preserved across environments
- GitHub integration functions from both environments

## Limitations

### Performance
- **Startup time**: Additional 10-30 seconds for container initialization
- **Resource overhead**: ~100-200MB RAM per container
- **File I/O**: Slight performance impact from volume mounting

### Features
- **VS Code integration**: Limited to web terminal interface
- **Host file access**: Only mounted directories accessible
- **Network access**: Configurable but isolated by default

## Troubleshooting

### Container Won't Start
```bash
# Check Docker is running
docker ps

# Verify claude-sandbox installation
claude-sandbox --version

# Check configuration
cat claude-sandbox.config.json
```

### Memory Not Persisting
```bash
# Verify volume mounting
docker inspect $(docker ps -q) | grep -A 5 "Mounts"

# Check APM memory path
ls -la apm/agents/
```

### Performance Issues
```bash
# Monitor container resources
docker stats

# Check container logs
claude-sandbox logs
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Security Profiles
Modify `src/config/apm-docker.config.json` for different security levels:

```json
{
  "security": {
    "networkAccess": "none",           // No external network
    "resourceLimits": {
      "cpus": "1",
      "memory": "2g"
    }
  }
}
```

### Multi-Container Coordination
Different agents can run in separate containers:
- Manager agent (host) - GitHub integration
- Developer agent (container) - Secure code execution  
- QA agent (container) - Testing isolation

## Migration

### From Non-Docker to Docker
No migration needed - add `--docker` flag to any new worktree:
```bash
# Existing workflow (unchanged)
./src/scripts/git/worktree-create.sh feature-branch

# Enhanced with security
./src/scripts/git/worktree-create.sh feature-branch --docker
```

### Disable Docker
Simply omit `--docker` flag - all existing workflows continue unchanged.

## Security Notes

### What Docker Protects
- Host file system isolation
- SSH key and credential protection
- System configuration isolation
- Resource consumption limits

### What Docker Doesn't Protect
- Network-based attacks (configurable)
- Container escape vulnerabilities (rare)
- Shared kernel exploits (theoretical)

### Best Practices
- Keep Docker updated for security patches
- Review generated configurations before use
- Monitor container resource usage
- Use specific security profiles for sensitive work

**Result**: APM Framework gains enterprise-grade security isolation while maintaining all existing functionality and workflows.
