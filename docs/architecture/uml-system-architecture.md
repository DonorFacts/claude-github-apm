## Agent Lifecycle Diagram

```plantuml
@startuml Agent_Lifecycle
!theme plain

start

:User starts CC instance;
:CC reads agent configuration;

if (Existing session?) then (yes)
  :Load session from registry;
  :Read context file;
  :Generate team status brief;
  :Resume with team awareness;
else (no)
  :Create new agent identity;
  :Register with team registry;
  :Initialize new context;
  :Generate team status brief;
  :Start fresh session;
endif

:Agent active with team awareness;

fork
  :Regular work with user;
  :Update context periodically;
fork again
  :Send heartbeat to registry;
  :Update team status;
fork again
  :Monitor for routing requests;
  :Analyze message domains;
endfork

if (System crash/restart?) then (yes)
  :Session marked as 'crashed';
  :Context preserved;
  stop
else (graceful shutdown)
  :Update final status;
  :Mark session as 'closed';
  :Notify dependent agents;
  stop
endif

## Team Coordination Sequence Diagram

```plantuml
@startuml Team_Coordination_Sequence
!theme plain

actor User
participant "dev-sarah-auth" as Sarah
participant "Team Registry" as Registry
participant "Intelligence Layer" as Intel
participant "dev-mike-ui" as Mike

User -> Sarah : "How do I style the dashboard buttons?"

Sarah -> Intel : analyze_message_domain("style dashboard buttons")
Intel -> Intel : domain = "ui-styling"
Intel -> Sarah : domain_mismatch(confidence=0.9, suggested="dev-mike-ui")

Sarah -> Registry : get_agent_status("dev-mike-ui")
Registry -> Sarah : {active: true, current_task: "dashboard components", terminal: "tab-3"}

Sarah -> User : """
ðŸ¤” I notice you're asking about dashboard styling, 
but I specialize in authentication systems.

You should talk to **dev-mike-ui** who's working on 
dashboard components (currently active in terminal tab 3).

Would you like me to help coordinate with him?
"""

User -> Sarah : "Yes, please coordinate"

Sarah -> Mike : coordinate_handoff(user_request="dashboard button styling")
Mike -> Sarah : acknowledge_handoff()

Sarah -> User : "I've notified dev-mike-ui. You can find him in terminal tab 3, or he may message you shortly."

note right of Sarah
  Sarah maintains context that 
  auth-related aspects of dashboard 
  styling should come back to her
end note

## Slack Integration Architecture

```plantuml

' Slack -> APM flow
CMD -> SCP : /apm-assign, /apm-status
SCP -> TAE : parse and route commands

TAE -> MIKE : assign specific task

' APM -> Slack flow  
SARAH -> WHS : status updates
MIKE -> WHS : task completion
WHS -> ACTIVITY : post team updates
TSR -> PROJ : project status

' Cross-agent coordination
SARAH <-> MIKE : dependency coordination
JENNIFER -> TSR : expertise insights

note right of SCP
  Processes commands like:
  /apm-assign @dev-sarah-auth "fix OAuth bug"
  /apm-status team
  /apm-handoff sarah -> mike

## Recovery Process Flow

```plantuml
@startuml Recovery_Process_Flow
!theme plain

start

:System restart detected;
:APM CLI started;

:Scan session registry;
:Identify crashed sessions;

if (Crashed sessions found?) then (yes)
  :List crashed sessions;
  
  :User runs 'apm list sessions --crashed';
  
  fork
    :Display session details;
    :Show last activity;
    :Show specialization;
  fork again
    :Analyze VS Code windows;
    :Map sessions to worktrees;
  endfork
  
  :User chooses recovery option;
  
  if (Recovery type?) then (all sessions)
    :apm reopen sessions --all;
    fork
      :Create terminals in VS Code Window 1;

    :Initialize with full context;

  :All agents restored with team awareness;
  :Team status synchronized;
  
else (no crashes)
  :All sessions healthy;

These diagrams illustrate the complete architecture for the APM persistent team management system, showing how agents maintain individual identity while coordinating as a team with intelligent routing and recovery capabilities.
