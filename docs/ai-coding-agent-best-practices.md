## Core Principles

### 1. **Simplicity and Transparency**

> "Consistently, the most successful implementations weren't using complex frameworks or specialized libraries. Instead, they were building with simple, composable patterns." - Anthropic

**Example:**
```python
# Direct API usage instead of complex frameworks
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    system="You are a senior software engineer specializing in TypeScript and React.",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
)
```

### 2. **XML Tag Structure**

XML tags improve response quality by up to 39% through better organization and clarity.

**Example:**
```xml
<task>
  <objective>Implement user authentication</objective>
  <constraints>
    <constraint>Use JWT tokens</constraint>
    <constraint>Implement refresh token rotation</constraint>
  </constraints>
  <success_criteria>
    <criterion>All endpoints secured</criterion>
    <criterion>Tests pass with 100% coverage</criterion>
  </success_criteria>
</task>
```

### 3. **Role-Based System Prompts**

Domain-specific roles dramatically improve performance without retraining.

**Example:**
```
You are a seasoned Full-Stack Developer with 10+ years of experience in:
- TypeScript, React, Node.js ecosystem
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices
- Microservices architecture
- CI/CD pipelines
- Security best practices
```

## Architectural Patterns

### 1. **ReAct Pattern (Reasoning + Acting)**

Combines tool calling, memory, and planning for dynamic problem-solving.

**Implementation:**
```
1. Reasoning: Analyze the task and available tools
2. Action: Execute the chosen tool
3. Observation: Process the result
4. Repeat until task completion
```

### 2. **Two-Mode System**

Popular in tools like Cline:
- **Plan Mode**: Strategic thinking and task decomposition
- **Act Mode**: Execution with iterative refinement

### 3. **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**

Encourages step-by-step reasoning for complex tasks.

**Example:**
```xml
<thinking>
  <step1>Identify the main components needed</step1>
  <step2>Check existing codebase patterns</step2>
  <step3>Design the implementation approach</step3>
  <step4>Consider edge cases and error handling</step4>
</thinking>
```

## Practical Implementation Guidelines

### 1. **Tool Documentation**

Clear, comprehensive tool documentation is critical.

**Example from Cline (11,000 character system prompt):**
```
### Read Tool
- Purpose: Reads file contents from the filesystem
- Parameters: 
  - file_path: Absolute path to the file
  - offset: Optional line number to start from
  - limit: Optional number of lines to read
- Returns: File contents with line numbers
- Error handling: Returns error if file doesn't exist
```

### 2. **Environmental Awareness**

Provide comprehensive context about the development environment.

**Example:**
```
Environment Context:
- OS: macOS Darwin 24.5.0
- Working Directory: /Users/dev/project
- Node Version: 20.11.0
- Package Manager: pnpm
- Git Branch: feature/auth-implementation
```

### 3. **Iterative Workflows**

Break complex tasks into manageable steps with validation.

**Example Workflow:**
```
1. Understand requirements → Validate with user
2. Research codebase → Document findings
3. Plan implementation → Get approval
4. Write tests → Ensure they fail
5. Implement code → Make tests pass
6. Refactor → Maintain test coverage
7. Document → Update relevant docs
```

## Testing and Quality Assurance

### 1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**

Mandatory for all feature implementations.

**Process:**
```
1. List happy path and edge cases
2. Define acceptance criteria
3. Write failing tests
4. Implement minimal code to pass
5. Refactor while maintaining coverage
```

### 2. **Continuous Validation**

```
After each code change:
- Run linters (ESLint, Prettier)
- Execute type checks (TypeScript)
- Run test suite
- Verify no regressions
```

## Token Efficiency

### 1. **Avoid Anti-Patterns**
- Don't generate full conversation logs (doubles token usage)
- Avoid verbose confirmations for every action
- Don't duplicate information in tool outputs

### 2. **Efficient Patterns**
- Use file storage for persistent data
- Reference rather than repeat information
- Update only deltas in memory files
- Batch multiple tool calls in single responses

## Safety and Security

### 1. **Never Commit Without Permission**
> "The tool will FAIL if you attempt to commit without user permission" - Claude Code System Prompt

### 2. **Security Best Practices**
- Never hardcode credentials
- Validate all inputs
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow OWASP guidelines
- Review generated code for vulnerabilities

## Multi-Agent Collaboration

### 1. **Clear Responsibility Boundaries**
> "For complex agentic workflows, creating a loop with a direct split of responsibilities works much more reliably than asking a single agent to plan, perform the work, and inspect its progress"

### 2. **Communication Patterns**
```
Manager Agent → assigns tasks → Developer Agent
Developer Agent → implements → returns results
Scrum Master → tracks progress → updates GitHub
```

## Performance Metrics

### 1. **Success Criteria Definition**
- Clear, measurable objectives
- Automated validation where possible
- Regular progress checkpoints

### 2. **Quality Indicators**
- Test coverage > 80%
- All linters pass
- Type safety maintained
- Documentation updated
- Performance benchmarks met

## Key Takeaways

1. **Start Simple**: Use direct LLM APIs before frameworks
2. **Be Explicit**: Clear instructions outperform clever prompts
3. **Use Structure**: XML tags and formatting improve results
4. **Iterate Continuously**: Measure and refine based on outcomes
5. **Maintain Safety**: Always validate and review generated code
6. **Document Everything**: Clear documentation enables better collaboration
