# Docker Integration Planning for Claude GitHub APM

Created: 2025-06-27  
Status: Planning Phase  
Priority: High - Security Enhancement  

## Executive Summary

Integration of Docker containerization with the Claude GitHub APM framework would provide secure sandboxing for dangerous permissions while maintaining our existing worktree/multi-agent architecture. This analysis evaluates the textcortex/claude-code-sandbox solution and proposes an integration path.

## Current APM Framework Architecture

### Existing Components
- **Git Worktrees**: Branch isolation with dedicated VS Code windows
- **Agent Memory System**: MEMORY.md + context saves for handovers
- **Handover Protocols**: Seamless agent transitions between worktrees
- **GitHub Integration**: Automatic issue creation and PR management
- **Multi-Window Coordination**: Terminal titles and agent boundaries

### Core Strengths
- Agent specialization with clear role boundaries
- Context preservation across sessions
- Automatic workflow orchestration
- GitHub issue tracking integration
- Token-optimized prompt engineering

## Recommended Solution: textcortex/claude-code-sandbox

### Technical Analysis

**Architecture:**
- Node.js-based orchestration tool
- Docker/Podman container isolation
- Per-session git branch management
- Web UI terminal interface
- Automatic credential forwarding

**Security Model:**
- Containers isolated from host system
- Read-only credential mounting
- Branch restrictions (no direct main commits)
- Interactive change approval workflow
- Autonomous execution with --dangerously-skip-permissions

**Key Features:**
- Configurable via JSON
- Custom Dockerfile support
- Multi-container management
- Automatic environment initialization
- Commit monitoring and review

### Gap Analysis: APM Framework vs. Claude Code Sandbox

#### Complementary Strengths
| APM Framework | Claude Code Sandbox |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Multi-agent coordination | Single-agent autonomy |
| Cross-session memory | Per-session isolation |
| GitHub issue integration | Branch management |
| Agent role specialization | Generic development assistant |
| Token optimization | Security isolation |
| Worktree management | Container management |

#### Potential Conflicts
1. **Session Management**: APM uses file-based context saves; Sandbox uses container isolation
2. **Agent Boundaries**: APM enforces role separation; Sandbox assumes single autonomous agent
3. **Memory Persistence**: APM maintains long-term memory; Sandbox starts fresh per session
4. **Workflow Integration**: APM integrates with GitHub issues; Sandbox focuses on code execution

## Integration Strategy

### Phase 1: Parallel Implementation (0-2 weeks)
**Objective**: Evaluate sandbox without disrupting existing workflows

**Actions:**
1. Install and test claude-code-sandbox in isolated environment
2. Create APM-compatible configuration templates
3. Test with sample projects outside main APM framework
4. Document compatibility and friction points

**Success Criteria:**
- Successful sandbox execution of typical APM tasks
- Clear understanding of integration challenges
- Performance and security baseline established

### Phase 2: Hybrid Architecture (2-6 weeks)
**Objective**: Integrate sandbox as optional security layer

**Design Approach:**
```
APM Framework (Host)
├── Worktree Management
├── Agent Coordination
├── Memory System
└── Docker Sandbox (Optional)
    ├── Secure Execution Environment
    ├── Isolated File System
    └── Controlled Network Access
```

**Implementation:**
1. Create APM-aware sandbox configuration
2. Modify worktree creation to optionally include Docker setup
3. Extend handover protocols to handle container state
4. Update agent initialization for containerized environments

**Key Modifications:**
- `src/prompts/git/worktrees/create.md`: Add Docker option
- `src/scripts/git/worktree-create.sh`: Container initialization
- Agent memory system: Handle containerized context

### Phase 3: Deep Integration (6-12 weeks)
**Objective**: Seamless APM + Docker experience

**Advanced Features:**
1. **Multi-Container Agent Coordination**: Each agent role in separate container
2. **Shared Memory Volumes**: Persistent agent memory across container restarts
3. **Network Isolation**: Agents can only communicate through defined channels
4. **Resource Management**: Per-agent CPU/memory limits
5. **Security Profiles**: Different permission levels per agent type

**Architecture Evolution:**
```
APM Docker Orchestration
├── Manager Agent Container (GitHub integration)
├── Developer Agent Container (code execution)
├── QA Agent Container (testing isolation)
├── Prompt Engineer Container (prompt development)
└── Shared Volumes
    ├── Agent Memory (persistent)
    ├── Project Files (mounted)
    └── Inter-Agent Communication
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Configuration Strategy
**APM Docker Config (`apm-docker.config.json`):**
```json
{
  "security": {
    "isolation_level": "standard|high|maximum",
    "network_access": "none|limited|full",
    "file_system": "readonly|limited|full"
  },
  "agents": {
    "developer": { "container": "apm-dev", "resources": {...} },
    "qa": { "container": "apm-qa", "resources": {...} }
  },
  "volumes": {
    "agent_memory": "./apm/agents",
    "project_files": ".",
    "shared_temp": "/tmp/apm-shared"
  }
}
```

### Worktree Integration
**Enhanced Creation Process:**
1. Standard worktree creation
2. Optional Docker environment setup
3. Container configuration based on agent roles
4. Volume mounting for memory persistence
5. Network setup for inter-container communication

### Memory System Adaptation
**Containerized Memory Strategy:**
- Agent MEMORY.md files mounted as volumes
- Context saves persist across container restarts
- Handover files accessible to new containers
- Git commits remain on host for consistency

### Security Boundaries
**Multi-Layer Security:**
1. **Container Isolation**: Each agent in separate container
2. **Network Segmentation**: Controlled inter-agent communication
3. **File System Limits**: Read-only project files, writable temp areas
4. **Resource Constraints**: Prevent resource exhaustion
5. **Audit Logging**: All container activities logged

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Performance overhead (2-5% typical)
- Learning curve for Docker basics
- Initial setup complexity

### Medium Risk
- Integration complexity with existing workflows
- Potential conflicts between APM and sandbox approaches
- Memory system compatibility issues

### High Risk
- Complete architectural overhaul if poorly implemented
- Loss of existing APM framework benefits
- Over-engineering security for minimal additional protection

## Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
1. **Incremental Integration**: Phase-based approach prevents major disruptions
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain non-Docker execution paths
3. **Isolation Testing**: Extensive testing in isolated environments

### Workflow Risks
1. **User Experience**: Maintain simplicity of current APM commands
2. **Agent Coordination**: Preserve existing handover mechanisms
3. **Performance**: Monitor and optimize container startup times

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Metrics
- Successful sandbox execution of 10+ typical APM tasks
- Security isolation verified through penetration testing
- Performance overhead < 10%

### Phase 2 Metrics
- Seamless Docker option in worktree creation
- Agent handovers work in containerized environments
- No degradation of existing APM functionality

### Phase 3 Metrics
- Multi-container agent coordination functional
- 99%+ uptime for containerized agents
- User satisfaction maintained or improved

## Resource Requirements

### Development Time
- **Phase 1**: 20-30 hours (evaluation and testing)
- **Phase 2**: 60-80 hours (hybrid implementation)
- **Phase 3**: 120-150 hours (deep integration)

### Infrastructure
- Docker Desktop or equivalent
- Additional system resources for containers
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure

### Learning Investment
- Docker fundamentals and security practices
- Container orchestration concepts
- APM framework modifications

## Conclusion

The textcortex/claude-code-sandbox provides excellent security isolation that complements our APM framework's strengths. A phased integration approach minimizes risk while maximizing benefits.

**Key Insight**: Rather than replacing our architecture, Docker should enhance it by providing secure execution boundaries while preserving agent coordination, memory systems, and workflow automation.

**Recommended Path**: Start with Phase 1 evaluation, then proceed based on results and user feedback. The hybrid approach in Phase 2 offers the best risk/reward balance for initial implementation.

**Critical Success Factor**: Maintain the simplicity and effectiveness of current APM workflows while adding security as an opt-in enhancement, not a mandatory complexity.
