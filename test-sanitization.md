# Token Sanitization Test

This file tests the automatic token sanitization features implemented in the container.

## Test Details
- **Created**: 2025-07-03 21:45 UTC
- **Purpose**: Verify automatic token cleanup prevents authentication issues
- **Expected**: Commit and push should work seamlessly with sanitized tokens

## Features Tested
1. Dockerfile entrypoint token sanitization
2. bot-config-loader.sh token cleaning
3. Hidden character removal from environment variables
4. Git authentication with cleaned tokens

If this commit/push succeeds, the permanent fix is working correctly!
