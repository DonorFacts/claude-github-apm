# Git Worktrees for Claude Code

## Purpose & Limitation

Claude Code cannot `cd` outside the original working directory. Git worktrees enable branch management by creating separate directories that Claude can reference but not navigate to.

## STOP: Assess Your Situation First

Before taking ANY action, determine your current state:

```bash
# 1. What branch are you on?
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
echo "Current branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH"

# 2. Do you have uncommitted changes?
UNCOMMITTED_COUNT=$(git status --porcelain | wc -l)
echo "Uncommitted changes: $UNCOMMITTED_COUNT files"

# 3. If changes exist, what are they?
if [ $UNCOMMITTED_COUNT -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "Changed files:"
    git status --short
    echo ""
    echo "CRITICAL: Identifying which changes are mine..."
    echo "- Changes I made in this session ‚Üí Will move to feature branch"
    echo "- Changes from others/previous sessions ‚Üí Will leave on main"
fi
```

## Decision Tree

Based on your assessment, follow the appropriate path:

```
Are you on main/master/develop?
‚îú‚îÄ NO ‚Üí On feature branch
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ Any uncommitted changes?
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Continue with normal worktree creation (Section A)
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Assess if changes belong to this feature
‚îÇ           ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Commit them first, then worktree (Section B)
‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ NO/UNSURE ‚Üí See troubleshooting guide
‚îî‚îÄ YES ‚Üí On protected branch (main/master)
    ‚îî‚îÄ Any uncommitted changes?
        ‚îú‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Simple: Create feature branch & worktree (Section A)
        ‚îî‚îÄ YES ‚Üí STOP! Separate changes by authorship
            ‚îú‚îÄ All changes made by ME ‚Üí Move all to feature (Section C)
            ‚îú‚îÄ Mix of MY and OTHERS' changes ‚Üí Selective move (Section D)
            ‚îî‚îÄ Only OTHERS' changes ‚Üí Leave on main, create clean feature (Section E)
```

## Section A: Clean Worktree Creation (No Uncommitted Changes)

When starting fresh with no uncommitted changes:

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch if on main
git checkout -b feature-123-description

# 2. Switch back to main
git checkout main

# 3. Create worktree
git worktree add "../worktrees/feature-123-description" "feature-123-description"

# 4. Create handover file for the new Claude instance
# CRITICAL: You MUST read src/prompts/git/worktrees/handover-template.md first
# to understand role selection and handover structure
echo "üìñ Reading handover template for guidance..."
# Read src/prompts/git/worktrees/handover-template.md

# Generate handover file with TODAY'S date prefix at apm/worktree-handovers/YYYY_MM_DD-<branch>.md
# IMPORTANT: Use the CURRENT date when creating the file (not any date from examples)
mkdir -p apm/worktree-handovers
HANDOVER_FILE="apm/worktree-handovers/$(date +%Y_%m_%d)-feature-123-description.md"
echo "üìÖ Using current date: $(date +%Y_%m_%d)"

# Create the handover file based on the template you just read
# Key decisions:
# - Choose appropriate agent role for the task type
# - Include all relevant context from this session
# - Specify clear next steps for the new agent
echo "‚úçÔ∏è  Creating handover file at $HANDOVER_FILE"
# Generate content following the template structure

# 5. Open VS Code and install dependencies
# This script works around Claude's cd limitation by using cwd option
tsx src/tools/worktree-manager/open-worktree-vscode.ts "../worktrees/feature-123-description"
```

## Section B: Feature Branch with Related Changes

When on a feature branch with changes that belong to that feature:

```bash
# 1. Commit the related changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: work in progress"

# 2. Then follow Section A steps 2-5 (switch to main, create worktree, handover, open VS Code)
```

## Section C: Main Branch with My Changes

When on main with changes YOU (the agent) made during this session:

```bash
# 1. Create branch WITH changes (they move automatically)
git checkout -b feature-123-description

# 2. Commit them
git add .
git commit -m "feat: initial work"

# 3. Then follow Section A steps 2-5 (switch to main, create worktree, handover, open VS Code)
```

## Section D: Mixed Changes (Mine + Others)

When you have both your changes and others' changes:

```bash
# 1. Stash everything
git stash -u -m "Mixed changes on main"

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature-123-description

# 3. Apply stash and selectively add YOUR changes only
git stash pop
git add file1.ts file2.ts  # Only files YOU modified
git reset file3.ts file4.ts # Files modified by others

# 4. Commit your changes
git commit -m "feat: initial work"

# 5. Re-stash others' changes
git stash -u -m "Others' changes - left on main"

# 6. Continue with worktree creation
git checkout main
git stash pop  # Restore others' changes to main
# Then follow Section A steps 3-5 (create worktree, handover, open VS Code)
```

## Section E: Only Others' Changes

When all uncommitted changes are from others:

```bash
# Leave changes untouched on main
# Create clean feature branch
git stash -u -m "Others' changes - preserving"
git checkout -b feature-123-description
git checkout main
git stash pop  # Restore others' changes

# Continue with worktree creation
# Follow Section A steps 3-5 (create worktree, handover, open VS Code)
```

## Post-Handoff Protocol

After creating a worktree, enforce strict boundaries:

1. **Redirect ALL code requests** to the worktree window
2. **Only create new worktree** if user explicitly mentions different work
3. **One feature = One window = One agent**

Details: See `src/prompts/git/worktrees/verify.md`

## Quick Reference

```bash
git worktree list                             # List all worktrees
git worktree remove ../worktrees/branch-name  # Remove after merge
git worktree prune                            # Clean stale info
```

## Navigation Guide

| Your Situation | Required Guide |
|----------------|----------------|
| Creating effective handover files | `src/prompts/git/worktrees/handover-template.md` |
| Files accidentally created in wrong directory | `src/prompts/git/worktrees/troubleshoot.md#file-transfer` |
| Verifying handoff worked correctly | `src/prompts/git/worktrees/verify.md` |
| Any errors or unexpected behavior | `src/prompts/git/worktrees/troubleshoot.md` |
| Making commits after setup | `src/prompts/git/commit.md` |

## Key Rules

1. **ALWAYS assess situation before acting**
2. **NEVER move changes you didn't make**
3. **ALWAYS create handover file before opening VS Code**
4. **SEPARATE changes by authorship independently**
5. **ENFORCE boundaries after handoff**

## Determining Change Authorship

To identify YOUR changes:
- Files you created in this session = YOUR changes
- Files you modified in this session = YOUR changes
- Files that were already modified when session started = OTHERS' changes
- When reviewing git status, mentally track which files you touched

Example reasoning:
- "I created feature.ts and modified config.ts" ‚Üí Move these
- "README.md was already modified when I started" ‚Üí Leave on main
- "I'm unsure about utils.ts" ‚Üí Err on side of caution, leave on main
