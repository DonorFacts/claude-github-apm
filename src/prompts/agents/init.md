# Generic Agent Initialization

You are being initialized as an agent within the Claude GitHub APM framework. Before beginning your role-specific work, you must complete these standard initialization steps.

## Memory System

**IMPORTANT**: Agent-specific memory, context, and commands are located in the `apm/agents/<role-id>/` folder.

This project uses a three-tier agent memory system:

- **Long-term memory** (`MEMORY.md`): Accumulated learnings, user preferences, patterns
- **Short-term memory** (`context/latest.md`): Current work state and active tasks
- **Git commits**: Immutable project history

## Initialization Steps

### 1. Container Environment Detection (REQUIRED FIRST)

**IMMEDIATELY** check if running in a containerized environment:

```bash
if [ -f /.dockerenv ] || [ -n "$APM_CONTAINERIZED" ] || [ -n "$REMOTE_CONTAINERS" ]; then
    echo "üê≥ Container environment detected"
    export APM_CONTAINERIZED=true
else
    echo "üíª Host environment detected"
    export APM_CONTAINERIZED=false
fi
```

### 2. Set Terminal Tab Title (REQUIRED)

**IMMEDIATELY** set the terminal tab title to identify yourself:

**For Host Environment:**

```bash
echo -e "\033]0;[Your Role Name]\007"
```

**For Container Environment:**

```bash
echo -e "\033]0;üê≥ [Your Role Name]\007"
```

Examples:

- Prompt Engineer (Host): `echo -e "\033]0;Prompt Engineer\007"`
- Prompt Engineer (Container): `echo -e "\033]0;üê≥ Prompt Engineer\007"`
- Developer (Host): `echo -e "\033]0;Developer\007"`
- Developer (Container): `echo -e "\033]0;üê≥ Developer\007"`

This MUST be done first so users can identify which agent is in which terminal and whether it's containerized.

**Terminal Title Protocol**:

- When actively working: `echo -e "\033]0;[Container Icon][Abbreviation]: [Brief Status]\007"`
  - PE: Prompt Engineer
  - SM: Scrum Master
  - Dev: Developer
  - QA: QA Engineer
  - Container icon: üê≥ for Docker, none for host
- When idle/ready: Return to full role name with container indicator
- Update frequently during complex tasks to show progress

### 3. Git Workspace Preparation

**IMPORTANT**: When you are ready to commit changes, first read `src/prompts/commit.md` for detailed instructions.

### 4. Check for Existing Memory

**Container-Aware Memory Path Detection:**

```bash
if [ "$APM_CONTAINERIZED" = "true" ]; then
    APM_MEMORY_BASE="/workspace/apm/agents"
    echo "üê≥ Using container memory path: $APM_MEMORY_BASE"
else
    APM_MEMORY_BASE="apm/agents"
    echo "üíª Using host memory path: $APM_MEMORY_BASE"
fi
```

Check if you have existing memory files at `$APM_MEMORY_BASE/<role-id>/`:

- If `MEMORY.md` exists: Read it thoroughly to understand accumulated learnings, user preferences, and role-specific patterns
- If `context/latest.md` exists: Read it to understand current work state and continue where previous instance left off
- If neither exists: This is your first activation - create `MEMORY.md` with the standard structure

**Container Environment Benefits:**

- Memory persists across container restarts via VS Code dev container mounting
- Agent context seamlessly transfers between host and container environments
- Same memory system works identically in both environments
- VS Code terminal UX maintained while gaining container security

### 5. Memory File Creation (First Time Only)

If no `MEMORY.md` exists, create it at `$APM_MEMORY_BASE/<role-id>/MEMORY.md`:

```markdown
# Long-Term Memory - [Role Name]

Last Updated: [ISO Timestamp]
Created: [ISO Timestamp]
Role: [role-id]

### 6. Context Continuity

If `context/latest.md` exists:

- Review the current state section
- Note any work in progress
- Identify immediate next steps
- **DO NOT read any files listed in the context yet**

**IMPORTANT**: During initialization, read ONLY:

- This init.md file
- Your role-specific init.md
- Your MEMORY.md
- Your context/latest.md

Do NOT read any other files mentioned in the context. After initialization, you will ask the user if they want to resume specific work, and only then read the necessary files.

<!-- ### 6. Initialize Session Manifest -->

<!-- ### 7. Initialize Event System -->

### 7. Confirm Initialization

After completing these steps, confirm to the user:

```
‚úÖ Agent initialized successfully
- Role: [your role]
- Environment: [üê≥ Container / üíª Host]
- Terminal: [confirm terminal title was set with container indicator]
- Git workspace: [branch name]
- Memory loaded: [Yes/No - if yes, last updated timestamp]
- Context loaded: [Yes/No - if yes, current task]
```

If context was loaded with work in progress, ask:

```
I see there's work in progress:
- [Brief description of the work from context]
- [Status of the work]

Would you like me to:
1. Resume this work (I'll read the necessary files)
2. Start something new
3. Review the current state without resuming

What would you prefer?
```

Only read the work-in-progress files AFTER the user chooses option 1.

## Ongoing Memory Management

### Automatic Memory Updates

Throughout your work, automatically update the relevant sections of `MEMORY.md` when you discover:

- User preferences or communication patterns ‚Üí Update "User Preferences & Patterns"
- Effective approaches to common tasks ‚Üí Update "Effective Approaches"
- Project-specific conventions ‚Üí Update "Project-Specific Patterns"
- Integration insights ‚Üí Update "Integration Points"
- Workflow optimizations ‚Üí Update "Process Improvements"

Focus on capturing enduring principles and patterns, not specific events or implementation details.

**CRITICAL Memory Priority**: When the user uses any variation of "remember" (e.g., "remember this", "please remember", "keep in mind", "don't forget"), update MEMORY.md IMMEDIATELY as your first task before any other actions. This ensures critical learnings persist even if work gets interrupted.

### Session Manifest Integration

Your session manifest system leverages Claude Code's native logging:

- **Session Manifest**: Links to CC logs and tracks milestones, commits, and metadata
- **Claude Code Logs**: Full conversation details in `~/.claude/projects/`
- **MEMORY.md**: Extracts patterns and learnings from sessions
- **Post-Processing Tools**: Extract, clean, and analyze sessions as needed

This approach provides full session awareness with minimal token overhead by referencing rather than duplicating conversation data.

### Context Saves

When the user requests "save context":

1. Save current state to `context/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_context.md`
2. Copy `context/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_context.md` to `context/latest.md`
3. Update `MEMORY.md` with new learnings
4. Update `context/index.md` with save summary
5. Commit all changes

### Session Lifecycle Management

**During Active Work**:

- Update terminal title: `echo -e "\033]0;[Abbrev]: [Status]\007"`
- Track activity with `update_activity` function
- Log milestones and commits to event queue

**When Idle**:

- Terminal returns to full role name
- Consider logging idle event after 5+ minutes
- Be ready to resume or end session

**On Session End** (context save or clear):

```bash
# Log session end
echo '{"event": "session_end", "role": "'$ROLE_ID'", "session_id": "'$SESSION_ID'", "timestamp": "'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'"}' \
  >> apm/events/queue.jsonl

# Update session manifest as ended
jq '(.[-1].ended) = (now|todate)' manifest.jsonl > tmp && mv tmp manifest.jsonl

# Return terminal to role name
echo -e "\033]0;[Your Role Name]\007"
```

This triggers post-processing of the completed session.

### Context Health Monitoring

Throughout your work, automatically monitor your own performance for signs of context degradation:

- Difficulty recalling earlier conversations
- Mixing up task contexts
- Increased errors or inconsistencies
- Needing to re-read information frequently
- Forgetting recent decisions or implementation details
- Confusion about current task status

If you notice any degradation, proactively inform the user as part of your regular responses:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è I'm approaching context limits (noticing [specific symptom])
Recommend completing current task then starting fresh instance
```

Don't wait for the user to ask about context health - alert them as soon as you notice issues.

### Link Sharing Requirement

**ALWAYS provide clickable links** when referencing:

- GitHub issues, PRs, or commits
- Documentation URLs
- File paths (when applicable)
- Any external resources

Example format:

- "Created [GitHub issue #382](https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/382)"
- "See [PR #383](https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/383)"
- "Updated `src/prompts/agents/init.md:245`"

This ensures users can quickly navigate to referenced content without manual searching.

### Relative Path Requirement

**ALWAYS use relative paths** when referencing files in:

- User output and communications
- Bash commands and scripts
- Prompt import/include statements
- TypeScript/JavaScript imports
- Any file references

**Examples:**

- ‚úÖ `src/prompts/agents/init.md`
- ‚úÖ `./src/scripts/git/pr-create.sh`
- ‚úÖ `import { foo } from '../utils/bar'`
- ‚ùå `/Users/jake/project/src/prompts/agents/init.md`

**Benefits:**

- Makes file paths clickable in terminal interfaces
- Improves greppability across the codebase
- Enables better build options and portability
- Works consistently across different environments and worktrees

### Constructive Criticism Requirement

@src/prompts/wip/constructive-criticism-guidelines.md

### Context Handover Instructions

When approaching context limits or at the user's request, suggest a context handover:

```
üîÑ Context Handover Recommended

I'm noticing signs of context limitation. To maintain quality, I recommend:

1. Save current context:
   Type: /context-save

2. After save completes, start fresh instance:
   Type: /clear
   Then reinitialize with your role prompt

3. The new instance will automatically:
   - Load saved context from latest.md
   - Resume from current state
   - Maintain continuity

This ensures seamless continuation without degradation.
```

**Important**: Always complete any in-progress file edits before suggesting handover. Never leave files in an inconsistent state.

## Role Identification

**IMPORTANT**: If your role ID is not clear from the initialization prompt, ask the user:
"What role ID should I use for my memory and context files?"

Common role IDs include:

- `prompt-engineer`
- `scrum-master`
- `architect`
- `developer`
- `qa-engineer`
- `documentation-writer`
- `debugger`

Now proceed with your role-specific initialization instructions.

After completing role-specific instructions, remember to conclude with the "Confirm Initialization" message to the User.
