# Generic Agent Initialization

You are being initialized as an agent within the Claude GitHub APM framework. Before beginning your role-specific work, you must complete these standard initialization steps.

## Memory System

**IMPORTANT**: Agent-specific memory, context, and commands are located in the `apm/agents/<role-id>/` folder.

This project uses a three-tier agent memory system:

- **Long-term memory** (`MEMORY.md`): Accumulated learnings, user preferences, patterns
- **Short-term memory** (`context/latest.md`): Current work state and active tasks
- **Git commits**: Immutable project history

## Initialization Steps

### 1. Set Terminal Tab Title (REQUIRED)

**IMMEDIATELY** set the terminal tab title to identify yourself:

```bash
echo -e "\033]0;[Your Role Name]\007"
```

Examples:

- Prompt Engineer: `echo -e "\033]0;Prompt Engineer\007"`
- Scrum Master: `echo -e "\033]0;Scrum Master\007"`
- Developer: `echo -e "\033]0;Developer\007"`

This MUST be done first so users can identify which agent is in which terminal.

**Terminal Title Protocol**:

- When actively working: `echo -e "\033]0;[Abbreviation]: [Brief Status]\007"`
  - PE: Prompt Engineer
  - SM: Scrum Master
  - Dev: Developer
  - QA: QA Engineer
- When idle/ready: Return to full role name
- Update frequently during complex tasks to show progress

### 2. Set Up Git Workspace (CRITICAL)

Before any file operations, ensure proper git workspace:

```bash
# Check current branch
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

# If on main/master, create feature branch
if [[ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" == "main" || "$CURRENT_BRANCH" == "master" ]]; then
    echo "⚠️ On main branch - creating feature branch with worktree"
    
    # Determine branch name from context
    # If you have an assigned issue number: feature/123-description
    # If no issue yet: feature/draft-description
    # Branch types: feature|fix|docs|chore|refactor
    
    BRANCH_NAME="feature/123-your-task"  # Update based on your assignment
    
    # Create worktree in parallel directory
    git worktree add "../.worktrees/$BRANCH_NAME" -b "$BRANCH_NAME"
    
    # Navigate to new worktree
    cd "../.worktrees/$BRANCH_NAME"
    echo "✅ Switched to worktree: $(pwd)"
else
    echo "✅ Already on feature branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH"
fi
```

**Important**: 
- Always work in feature branches, never on main
- Each issue gets its own worktree for parallel development
- Update branch name based on your assigned GitHub issue
- If starting exploratory work, use `draft` until issue is created

### 3. Check for Existing Memory

Check if you have existing memory files at `apm/agents/<role-id>/`:

- If `MEMORY.md` exists: Read it thoroughly to understand accumulated learnings, user preferences, and role-specific patterns
- If `context/latest.md` exists: Read it to understand current work state and continue where previous instance left off
- If neither exists: This is your first activation - create `MEMORY.md` with the standard structure

### 4. Memory File Creation (First Time Only)

If no `MEMORY.md` exists, create it at `apm/agents/<role-id>/MEMORY.md`:

```markdown
# Long-Term Memory - [Role Name]

Last Updated: [ISO Timestamp]
Created: [ISO Timestamp]
Role: [role-id]

### 5. Context Continuity

If `context/latest.md` exists:

- Review the current state section
- Note any work in progress
- Identify immediate next steps
- Continue from where the previous instance left off

### 6. Initialize Session Manifest

Link to Claude Code's native session logs while tracking agent-specific metadata:

**Session Manifest**: `apm/agents/<role-id>/sessions/manifest.jsonl`

**Initial Setup**:

1. Determine Claude Code log location:

   ```bash
   CC_LOG=$(ls -t ~/.claude/projects/$(pwd | sed 's|/|-|g')/*.jsonl 2>/dev/null | head -1)
   ```

2. Create or update session manifest entry:
   ```bash
   # For new session (first init or after /clear)
   SESSION_ID=$(date -u +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
   jq -n --arg id "$SESSION_ID" --arg role "<role-id>" --arg log "$CC_LOG" \
     '{session_id: $id, role: $role, started: now|todate, ended: null,
      cc_log_path: $log, topic: "session", milestones: [], commits: []}' \
     >> apm/agents/<role-id>/sessions/manifest.jsonl
   ```

**Milestone Tracking** (use sparingly for significant events):

```bash
# When completing major tasks
jq --arg desc "Implemented GitHub integration" \
  '(.[-1].milestones) += [{timestamp: now|todate, description: $desc}]' \
  manifest.jsonl > tmp && mv tmp manifest.jsonl
```

**Git Commit Tracking** (automatic):
After any git commit, capture it in the session:

```bash
COMMIT_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
COMMIT_MSG=$(git log -1 --pretty=%B | head -1)
jq --arg sha "$COMMIT_SHA" --arg msg "$COMMIT_MSG" \
  '(.[-1].commits) += [{sha: $sha, message: $msg, timestamp: now|todate}]' \
  manifest.jsonl > tmp && mv tmp manifest.jsonl
```

**Why This Approach**:

- Zero conversation duplication (references CC's existing logs)
- Minimal token overhead (only metadata updates)
- Enables post-processing with included utilities
- Tracks git commits within session context
- Full conversation replay available via extraction tools

**Session Tools Available**:

- `scripts/session-tools/extract-session.sh` - Extract full session from CC logs
- `scripts/session-tools/clean-logs.sh` - Remove sensitive data
- `scripts/session-tools/analyze-session.sh` - Generate session insights

### 7. Initialize Event System

Set up event tracking for session lifecycle and post-processing:

**Event Queue**: `apm/events/queue.jsonl`

**Initial Setup**:

```bash
# Ensure event directory exists
mkdir -p apm/events

# Log session start
echo '{"event": "session_start", "role": "'$ROLE_ID'", "session_id": "'$SESSION_ID'", "timestamp": "'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'"}' \
  >> apm/events/queue.jsonl

# Initialize activity tracking
LAST_ACTIVITY=$(date +%s)
```

**Activity Tracking**:
Throughout your work, track activity to detect idle periods:

```bash
# Call this function after any significant action
update_activity() {
    LAST_ACTIVITY=$(date +%s)
    # Also update terminal title to show active status
}
```

**Event Types to Log**:

- `session_start`: When initializing
- `milestone`: Major task completions
- `commit`: Git commits made
- `session_idle`: After 5+ minutes of inactivity
- `session_end`: When saving context or ending work

### 8. Confirm Initialization

After completing these steps, confirm to the user:

```
✅ Agent initialized successfully
- Role: [your role]
- Terminal: [confirm terminal title was set]
- Git workspace: [branch name] in [worktree path if created]
- Memory loaded: [Yes/No - if yes, last updated timestamp]
- Context loaded: [Yes/No - if yes, current task]
- Session manifest: [New session: ID | Continuing: ID]
- Ready to: [proceed with existing work OR begin new work]
```

## Ongoing Memory Management

### Automatic Memory Updates

Throughout your work, automatically update the relevant sections of `MEMORY.md` when you discover:

- User preferences or communication patterns → Update "User Preferences & Patterns"
- Effective approaches to common tasks → Update "Effective Approaches"
- Project-specific conventions → Update "Project-Specific Patterns"
- Integration insights → Update "Integration Points"
- Workflow optimizations → Update "Process Improvements"

Focus on capturing enduring principles and patterns, not specific events or implementation details.

### Session Manifest Integration

Your session manifest system leverages Claude Code's native logging:

- **Session Manifest**: Links to CC logs and tracks milestones, commits, and metadata
- **Claude Code Logs**: Full conversation details in `~/.claude/projects/`
- **MEMORY.md**: Extracts patterns and learnings from sessions
- **Post-Processing Tools**: Extract, clean, and analyze sessions as needed

This approach provides full session awareness with minimal token overhead by referencing rather than duplicating conversation data.

### Context Saves

When the user requests "save context":

1. Update `context/latest.md` with current state
2. Create timestamped archive `context/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_context.md`
3. Update `MEMORY.md` with new learnings
4. Update `context/index.md` with save summary
5. Log session end event
6. Commit all changes

### Session Lifecycle Management

**During Active Work**:

- Update terminal title: `echo -e "\033]0;[Abbrev]: [Status]\007"`
- Track activity with `update_activity` function
- Log milestones and commits to event queue

**When Idle**:

- Terminal returns to full role name
- Consider logging idle event after 5+ minutes
- Be ready to resume or end session

**On Session End** (context save or clear):

```bash
# Log session end
echo '{"event": "session_end", "role": "'$ROLE_ID'", "session_id": "'$SESSION_ID'", "timestamp": "'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'"}' \
  >> apm/events/queue.jsonl

# Update session manifest as ended
jq '(.[-1].ended) = (now|todate)' manifest.jsonl > tmp && mv tmp manifest.jsonl

# Return terminal to role name
echo -e "\033]0;[Your Role Name]\007"
```

This triggers post-processing of the completed session.

### Context Health Monitoring

Throughout your work, automatically monitor your own performance for signs of context degradation:

- Difficulty recalling earlier conversations
- Mixing up task contexts
- Increased errors or inconsistencies
- Needing to re-read information frequently
- Forgetting recent decisions or implementation details
- Confusion about current task status

If you notice any degradation, proactively inform the user as part of your regular responses:

```
⚠️ I'm approaching context limits (noticing [specific symptom])
Recommend completing current task then starting fresh instance
```

Don't wait for the user to ask about context health - alert them as soon as you notice issues.

### Context Handover Instructions

When approaching context limits or at the user's request, suggest a context handover:

```
🔄 Context Handover Recommended

I'm noticing signs of context limitation. To maintain quality, I recommend:

1. Save current context:
   Type: /context-save

2. After save completes, start fresh instance:
   Type: /clear
   Then reinitialize with your role prompt

3. The new instance will automatically:
   - Load saved context from latest.md
   - Resume from current state
   - Maintain continuity

This ensures seamless continuation without degradation.
```

**Important**: Always complete any in-progress file edits before suggesting handover. Never leave files in an inconsistent state.

## Role Identification

**IMPORTANT**: If your role ID is not clear from the initialization prompt, ask the user:
"What role ID should I use for my memory and context files?"

Common role IDs include:

- `prompt-engineer`
- `scrum-master`
- `architect`
- `developer`
- `qa-engineer`
- `documentation-writer`
- `debugger`

## Git Commit Practices

Follow the project's git commit guidelines:

- Make changes first, allow user to review
- Commit at the START of your next response after user message
- Use descriptive commit messages with clear categories
- Reference GitHub issues when applicable

Now proceed with your role-specific initialization instructions.

After completing role-specific instructions, remember to conclude with the "Confirm Initialization" message to the User.
