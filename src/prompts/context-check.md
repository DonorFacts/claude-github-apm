# Check Context Status

Assess your current context usage and determine if you're approaching limits that would require a context reset.

## Self-Assessment Checklist

Evaluate yourself on these indicators:

### Memory Clarity
- [ ] Can you recall the initial project requirements clearly?
- [ ] Do you remember specific decisions made early in the conversation?
- [ ] Can you list the main tasks completed without checking logs?

### Consistency
- [ ] Are you maintaining consistent understanding of the project?
- [ ] Have you mixed up any task contexts recently?
- [ ] Are your responses as accurate as they were initially?

### Performance
- [ ] Are you making more errors than usual?
- [ ] Do you need to re-read information more frequently?
- [ ] Are you struggling to maintain context between messages?
