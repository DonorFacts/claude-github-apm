# Most Recent Transcript Command

This command opens the most recently modified Claude Code session transcript in VS Code, based on file system timestamps.

## Instructions

To open the most recent transcript in VS Code, I'll:

1. Find the most recently modified .jsonl file in ~/.claude/projects/
2. Open it in VS Code via host-bridge

```bash
tsx src/scripts/session/open-most-recent-transcript.ts
```

## How it Works

This approach uses file system scanning to find the transcript file with the most recent modification time. This captures the currently active conversation regardless of hook capture timing.

- Scans all .jsonl files in the Claude projects directory
- Sorts by modification time (most recent first)
- Opens the most recent file in VS Code

## Use Cases

- **Active Session Access**: Always opens the currently active conversation
- **Hook-Independent**: Works even if hook capture fails or is delayed
- **Backup Method**: Reliable fallback when hook data is stale

## Implementation Details

- **Method**: File system timestamp-based detection
- **Script**: `src/scripts/session/open-most-recent-transcript.ts`
- **Sorting**: By modification time (newest first)
- **VS Code**: Opens via host-bridge integration
